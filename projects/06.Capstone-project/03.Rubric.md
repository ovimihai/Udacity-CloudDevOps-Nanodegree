## Set Up Pipeline

| CRITERIA                                    | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create Github repository with project code. | All project code is stored in a GitHub repository and a link to the repository has been provided for reviewers.                                  |
| Use image repository to store Docker images | The project uses a centralized image repository to manage images built in the project. After a clean build, images are pushed to the repository. |

## Build Docker Container

| CRITERIA                               | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execute linting step in code pipeline  | Code is checked against a linter as part of a Continuous Integration step (demonstrated w/ two screenshots) |
| Build a Docker container in a pipeline | The project takes a Dockerfile and creates a Docker container in the pipeline.                              |

## Successful Deployment

| The Docker container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster       | The cluster is deployed with CloudFormation or Ansible. This should be in the source code of the studentâ€™s submission.                                                                                             |
| Use Blue/Green Deployment or a Rolling Deployment successfully | The project performs the correct steps to do a blue/green or a rolling deployment into the environment selected. Student demonstrates the successful completion of chosen deployment methodology with screenshots. |

Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
1. Perform additional CI steps in the pipeline outside of just linting.
2. Perform security scanning of the Docker containers
3. Post-deployment add testing of your application
