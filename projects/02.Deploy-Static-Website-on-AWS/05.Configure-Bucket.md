> Did you notice that enabling the static website hosting requires you to make your bucket public?  
> In the snapshot above, it says "For your customers to access the content at the website endpoint, you must make all your content **publicly readable**."

1. For both "Index document" and "Error document", enter "index.html" and click "Save". After successfully saving the settings, check the **Static website hosting** section again under the **Properties** tab. You must now be able to view the [website endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoints.html) as shown below:
