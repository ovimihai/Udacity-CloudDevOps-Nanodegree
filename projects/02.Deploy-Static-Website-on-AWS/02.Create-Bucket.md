One of the convenient naming conventions is `my-123456789-bucket`, where you can replace `123456789` with your 12 digit AWS account ID.

1. In the **Bucket settings for Block Public Access** section, uncheck the "Block all public access". It will enable the public access to the bucket objects via the S3 object URL.
> 
> **Note** - We are allowing the public access to the bucket contents because we are going to host a static website in this bucket. **Hosting requires the content should be publicly readable.**
