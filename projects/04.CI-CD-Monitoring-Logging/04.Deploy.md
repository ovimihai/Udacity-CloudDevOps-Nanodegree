## Section 2

### Utilize Deployment Strategies to Design and Build CI/CD Pipelines that Support Continuous Delivery Processes

### Set up CircleCI

* Set up a CircleCI [free account](https://circleci.com/signup/?source-button=free), if you haven't already, that you can use throughout this project.

The free account includes 2500 credits per week which equals around 70 builds. This should be enough as long as you are conservative with your builds. _If you run out of credits, you can create another account and continue working._

* Create a new project in CircleCI using your project (forked) GitHub repo.

* Ensure a workflow starts with the jobs in your `config.yml` file. If you need to take a look at some samples, Circle CI was nice enough to [give us a few](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/sample-config).
> 
> If your Github repo is connected to CircleCI correctly, then the commits/pushes to repo will trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically.

# ToDo

Let's start coding different jobs in the `.circleci/config.yml` file.
> 
> **Tip**: We suggest you make a copy of the existing config file, as `config-sample.yml` for reference, and start afresh from scratch.

## 1\. Build Phase

The goal of a build phase is to compile/lint the source code to check for syntax errors or unintentional typos in code. Note that throughout this project, you should have separate jobs for the frontend and backend so that failure alerts are more descriptive.

* Find the job named `build-frontend` in the `.circleci/config.yml` file.
  * Select a Docker image that is compatible with NodeJS.
```
     - image: circleci/node:13.8.0 
```
  * Add code to build/compile the front-end.
``` 
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

* Find another job named `build-backend`
  * Select a Docker image that is compatible with NodeJS.
  * Add code to build/compile the back-end.

* Add jobs to the `workflows` section, if not already.

* Push your commits. It will trigger the CircleCI pipeline. Jobs should fail if code cannot be compiled (fail for the right reasons), and **a failed build should stop all future jobs.** We have provided an easy-to-fix compile error in the code to prove the jobs fail. Provide a screenshot of jobs that failed because of compile errors. **\[SCREENSHOT01\]**

* Fix the intentional error in the [/backend/src/main.ts](https://github.com/udacity/cdond-c3-projectstarter/blob/7224513b309e3cf1a34497fdc8682ef4d50413d2/backend/src/main.ts#L31) file that caused the compilation error. See code-comment that guides you to the fix. On pushinig your changes to the repo, the pipeline will continue.

## 2\. Test Phase

Unit tests are one of the many very important building blocks of a system that enables Continuous Delivery (notice, we didn't say "the only or most important thing"). UdaPeople believes that tests should come first just like they do in the scientific method. So, if a test fails, it's because the code is no longer trustworthy. Only trustworthy code should get a ticket to continue the ride!

In this test phase, remember that we separate the frontend and backend into separate jobs!

* Find the `test-frontend` job in the config file.
  * Select the Docker image that is compatible with NodeJS.
  * Write code to run the unit tests.
    
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run test
```

* Find the `test-backend` job, and perform the similar steps.

* Add jobs to the `workflows` section, if not already.

* Push your commits. It will trigger the CircleCI pipeline. Both the above unit test jobs should fail due to the intentional failing tests (details in the next point) and prevent any future jobs from running.

* Provide a screenshot of the failed unit tests in the "Test Failures" tab. **\[SCREENSHOT02\]**

**SCREENSHOT02** Example

* We have provided the following intentional failing test in both frontend and backend. See code-comment that guides you to the fix:
  * [frontend/src/app/components/LoadingMessage/LoadingMessage.spec.tsx](https://github.com/udacity/cdond-c3-projectstarter/blob/7224513b309e3cf1a34497fdc8682ef4d50413d2/frontend/src/app/components/LoadingMessage/LoadingMessage.spec.tsx#L11)
  * [backend/src/modules/domain/employees/commands/handlers/employee-activator.handler.spec.ts](https://github.com/udacity/cdond-c3-projectstarter/blob/7224513b309e3cf1a34497fdc8682ef4d50413d2/backend/src/modules/domain/employees/commands/handlers/employee-activator.handler.spec.ts#L22)

* Fix the unit tests and make the job succeed.

## 3\. Analyze Phase

UdaPeople handles some private information like social security numbers, salary amount, etc. It would be not be ideal if a package with a known vulnerability left a security hole in our application, giving hackers access to that information! That's why we should include a job that checks for known vulnerabilities every time we check in new code.

* Find the `scan-frontend` job in the config file.
  * Select a Docker image that is compatible with NodeJS.
  * Use `npm` to "audit" the code to check for known security vulnerabilities in the packages.
    
```
cd frontend
npm install
# npm install oauth-sign@^0.9.0
npm audit --audit-level=critical
```

> **Note** that the `--audit-level` parameter above specifies the minimum vulnerability level that will cause the command to fail. This option does not filter the report output, it simply changes the command's failure threshold.

* Find the `scan-backend` job in the config file, and perform the similar steps.

* Add jobs to the `workflows` section, if not already. Also, a failed analysis should stop all future jobs.

Structure of the config file after the analyze phase

* Push your commits. Job should fail due to critical vulnerabilities present in the starter code (fail for the right reasons). We left you an intentional vulnerability to cause a failure (details in the next point below). Provide a screenshot of jobs that failed because of vulnerable packages listed. **\[SCREENSHOT03\]**

![Job properly failing because of security vulnerabilities.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f20dbc9_screenshot03/screenshot03.png)

**SCREENSHOT03** Example

* One of the ways to fix the critical vulnerabilities in your **local** is to run the fix command individually in both frontend and backend:
    
```
# Do not use the --force option along with the command below in your local
npm audit fix --audit-level=critical
```    

But, the command above may:
  * leave behind few critical vulnerabilities that require manual review.
  * behave differently on different Node/npm versions locally.
  * cause the build/test job to fail.

In addition, the vulnerabilities evolve with time.

* Therefore, you need to upgrade the vulnerable packages in the _backend/package.json_ file in your local **manually** to:
```    
"class-validator": "0.12.2"
"standard-version": "^7.0.0"
```

> The idea here is to have you understand how to fix the vulnerable packages in the code. However, the prime objective of the project is building CI/CD pipelines on AWS.

* To make the `scan-frontend` and `scan-backend` jobs pass, you can use the following code in the jobs:

```
npm audit fix --audit-level=critical --force
# If the "npm audit fix" command above could not fix all critical vulnerabilities, try “npm audit fix --force” again
npm audit --audit-level=critical
```    

Note that the `npm audit fix` in the jobs above will not have any impact on the actual code being deployed in the further jobs.

* Push your commits to the remote repository on Github.

## 4\. Alerts

When a build fails for any reason, the UdaPeople dev team needs to know about it. That way they can jump in and save the day. You're going to add an alert so that botched builds raise a nice wavy red flag.

* Integrate Slack, email or another communication tool to receive alerts when jobs fail. Our examples are using Slack, but you should feel free to use the communication tool to which you are most accustomed.

* The steps for configurinig the Slack notification are
  1. [Setup Authentication](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/slack-orb/wiki/Setup)
  2. [Integrate Slack orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack)

Slack integration w/ CircleCI

* Recently, the CircleCI has auto-enabled the email notification for all failed builds.

Default Notification on Email

* Provide a screenshot of an alert from one of your failed builds. **\[SCREENSHOT04\]**
