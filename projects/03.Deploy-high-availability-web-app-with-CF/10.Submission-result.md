## Meets Specifications

## Congratulations![:tada:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/tada.png)

You have done exceptionally well in completing this project.

I want to commend the hard-work and effort you've put into this project. It seems to be a bit tricky but you have scaled through. Please up the hard-work and subsequent projects won't be a hard nut to crack

Now that you have learnt enough about infra, try to deploy a lambda function, that gets and puts some data in a database.  
You can also learn about best practices in Cloudformation.  
Please go through the code review once.

Happy Cloudforming ![:computer:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/computer.png) and Stay Udacious

Now that you have learned basics of infra and instance deployment using cloudformation, we would suggest you to go through cloudformation best practices:

* [Deploying ec2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/infrastructure-and-automation/best-practices-for-deploying-ec2-instances-with-aws-cloudformation/)
* [General best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
* [Related to security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/aws-cloudformation-security-best-practices/)

## The Basics

The more the better, but an exaggerated number of parameters can be messy ( say, 10 or more ). 1 or 0 is definitely lacking.

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) All resources contain the required number of parameters.

I want to share with you some interesting cases of when it is useful to use parameters, that way in your next projects you can check if these cases apply and create parameters for them.

* A parameter is an effective way to specify sensitive information, such as user names and passwords, that you don't want to store in the template itself.
* It is also a way to specify information that might be unique to the specific application or configuration you are deploying, for example, a domain name or instance type.
* It could a good idea to set the information related to the Amazon EC2 instance type as parameters. This can help you to easily adjust the EC2 instance type values. Like in this example:
    
    "Parameters" : { "InstanceTypeParameter" : { "Type" : "String", "Default" : "t2.micro", "AllowedValues" : ["t2.micro", "m1.small", "m1.large"], "Description" : "Enter t2.micro, m1.small, or m1.large. Default is t2.micro." } } 

This is the mandatory section of the script, we are looking for a LoadBalancer, Launch Configuration, AutoScaling group a health check, security groups and a Listener and Target Group.

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Great! All required resources have been used.

This is optional, but it would be nice to have a URL here with the Load Balancer DNS Name and "http" in front of it .

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Outputs have been shown

If the student provides a URL to verify his work is running properly, it will be a page that says "it works! Udagram, Udacity"

Nice! Always remember to delete your stack after you are done with testing to avoid recurring charges.

## Load Balancer

The auto-scaling group needs to have a property that associates it with a target group. The Load Balancer will have a Listener rule associated with the same target group

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Read more about Network Load balancer and Application load balancer [here](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-application-load-balancer-and-network-load-balancer-cb8b6cd296a4)

Port 80 should be used in Security groups, health checks and listeners associated with the load balancer

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Nice job! You have used port 80 in security groups, health checks and listeners.

## Auto-Scaling

Students should be using PRIV-NET ( private subnets ) for their auto-scaling instances

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Extra Resources that you may go through

* [Practical VPC design](https://medium.com/aws-activate-startup-blog/practical-vpc-design-8412e1a18dcc)
* [Benifits of autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-benefits.html)

The machine should have 10 GB or more of disk and should be a t3.small or better.

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) 10GB volume has been attached to the instances

There shouldn't be a 'keyname' property in the launch config

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Meets specifications

## Bonus

Any values in the output section are a bonus

![:white_check_mark:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/white_check_mark.png) Meets specifications

Any resource of type AWS:![:EC2:](https://review.udacity.com/assets/images/emojis/EC2.png):Instance, optional, but nice to have.
