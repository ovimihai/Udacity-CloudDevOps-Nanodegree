As your final project, you'll be faced with a real scenario.

Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. We have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.

There will be two parts to this project:

* **Diagram**: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.

* **Script (Template and Parameters)**: The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.

### Starter Code

You will find starter code for the project in this [Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c2-Infrastructure-as-Code-v1). The same repo has the resources used in the lesson demos/exercises for a quick reference.
