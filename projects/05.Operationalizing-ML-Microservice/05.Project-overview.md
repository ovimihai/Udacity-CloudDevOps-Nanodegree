# Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app---in a provided file, `app.py`---that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls.

## The Project Files

To get the starting project files, it is recommended that you **clone the Github repository**, then work locally and push your complete project to a new, Github repository of your own.

To clone this repository from a command line or terminal, you should navigate to a directory where you want to save this repository (I often use my Desktop) and then copy-paste the following commands:
    
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices.git cd DevOps_Microservices/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes

## Project Submission

Before submitting a link to your complete, project repository, make sure you have included all required and complete files (including `run_kubernetes.sh`, `run_docker.sh`, `docker_out.txt`, `kubernetes_out.txt`, and a `.circleci` build directory).
> 
> **RUBRIC:** You should verify that your project is complete by reading each item in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

Your final project should cover the following tasks:

* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**
