# Project Structure

**This project includes _most_ of the necessary files for submission.**

* You will need to create a `.circleci` directory and `config.yml` file therein, but any other files will just need to be modified and completed.
* You are expected to submit a complete project via a link to a Github repository; if this is your first time using Github, it may be helpful to take a look at our [free course on using Github for version control](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123).
* Many code tasks, will be marked as `Step x` or `TO DOs` in the project files; you should complete each step before submitting your project for review.

## The Project Files

To get the starting project files, it is recommended that you **clone the Github repository**, then work locally and push your complete project to a new, [Github](https://github.com/) repository of your own. Alternatively, you could download the code as a zip file.

### Cloning a Repository

To clone this repository from a command line or terminal, you should navigate to a directory where you want to save this repository (I often use my Desktop) and then copy-paste this command:
    
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices.git 

Then navigate to the downloaded project directory using two more commands, in order:
    
    cd DevOps_Microservices
    cd project-ml-microservice-kubernetes 

This should get you into the main working project directory that has all the starter files. You can test that you are in the correct directory by seeing if you can access one of the project files from the command line. You can type `cat Makefile` to see the starting `Makefile` in the project directory, for example.

## CircleCI

Again, _most_ of the project files are included as complete files or as files that you need to change and complete. The only file and directory you'll need to add will be when you create your own Github project repository.

When you have your own repository, you will be required to add your own [CircleCI directory](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#adding-a-yml-file) to your repository. The `yaml` file that tests your code can be downloaded by clicking [this link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cda0d76_config/config.yml). You can upload this directly to your repository or copy-paste the tests that are in it.
