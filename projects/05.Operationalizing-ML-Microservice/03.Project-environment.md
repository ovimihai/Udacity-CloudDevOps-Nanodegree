# Create and activate an environment

All of these instructions are to be completed via a terminal/command line prompt.

## 1\. Create and Activate an Environment

#### Git and version control

These instructions also assume you have `git` installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first from this [Github installation page](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

**Now, you're ready to create your local environment!**

1. If you haven't already done so, clone the project repository, and navigate to the project folder.
    
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices.git
    cd DevOps_Microservices/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes 

2. Create (and activate) a new environment, named `.devops` with Python 3\. If prompted to proceed with the install `(Proceed [y]/n)` type y.
    
    python3 -m venv ~/.devops
    source ~/.devops/bin/activate 

At this point your command line should look something like: `(.devops) <User>:project-ml-microservice-kubernetes<user>$`. The `(.devops)` indicates that your environment has been activated, and you can proceed with further package installations.

1. Installing dependencies via project `Makefile`. Many of the project dependencies are listed in the file `requirements.txt`; these can be installed using `pip` commands in the provided `Makefile`. While in your project directory, type the following command to install these dependencies.
    
    make install 

Now most of the `.devops` libraries are available to you. There are a couple of other libraries that we'll be using, which can be downloaded as specified, below.

# Other Libraries

While you still have your `.devops` environment activated, you will still need to install:

* Docker
* Hadolint
* Kubernetes (Minikube)

## Docker

You will need to use Docker to build and upload a containerized application. If you already have this installed and created a docker account, you may skip this step.

1. You'll need to [create a free docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup), where you'll choose a unique username and link your email to a docker account. **Your username is your unique docker ID.**
2. To install the latest version of docker, choose the Community Edition (CE) for your operating system, [on docker's installation site](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/). It is also recommended that you install the latest, **stable** release:
3. After installation, you can verify that you've successfully installed docker by printing its version in your terminal: `docker --version`

![docker version](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cda1a91_screen-shot-2019-05-13-at-6.31.52-pm/screen-shot-2019-05-13-at-6.31.52-pm.png)

## Run Lint Checks

This project also must pass two lint checks; `hadolint` checks the Dockerfile for errors and `pylint` checks the `app.py` source code for errors.

1. Install `hadolint` following the instructions, [on hadolint's page](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint):

**For Mac:**
    
     brew install hadolint 

**For Windows:**
    
     scoop install hadolint 

2. In your terminal, type: `make lint` to run lint checks on the project code. If you haven't changed any code, all requirements should be satisfied, and you should see a printed statement that rates your code (and prints out any additional comments):
    
    ------------------------------------ Your code has been rated at 10.00/10

## Install Minikube

To run a Kubernetes cluster locally, for testing and project purposes, you need the Kubernetes package, Minikube. This operates in a virtual machine and so you'll need to download two things: A virtual machine (aka a hypervisor) then minikube. Thorough installation instructions can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/). Here is how I installed minikube:

1. Install VirtualBox:

**For Mac:**
    
    brew cask install virtualbox 

**For Windows**, I recommend using a [Windows host](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

1. Install minikube:

**For Mac:**
    
    brew cask install minikube 

**For Windows**, I recommend using the [Windows installer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

## That's it!

Setting up an environment is an important part of development. Now you are ready to start working on the project files to containerize a machine learning application!

You should return to this page if you need to troubleshoot any dependency issues.

## Troubleshooting

* In general, you can verify installation by checking the version of a library, ex. `kubectl version` or `docker --version`. If there is no package found, you may need to install that library.
* **Mac issue**: If you get an error `error: invalid active developer path`, that means you need to install some Xcode developer tools. You can do this on Mac by running this terminal command: `xcode-select --install`
