Congratulations on completing the project! It shows your understanding of the AWS services. Keep up the good work and looking forward to your next projects

## Website Files

The S3 bucket is visible in the AWS Management console.

Very good job!! You hosted the website provided by Udacity. Now you can try to create static websites with Angular. This is a good strategy, but it is important that you know that [ANGULAR has PROBLEMS for SEO in this article](https://searchengineland.com/angular-universal-what-you-need-to-know-for-seo-311437)

The student has submitted a screenshot showing all the website files uploaded to the newly created S3 bucket.

Very good job. I want to continue my talk about encouraging you to create your own static websites using angular, but these apps can have SEO problems if you don't plan them well and if you don't deploy them correctly. This is a very good [tutorial on how to make your Angular web apps discoverable and better in SEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=_bZDjQOMf4U)

The S3 bucket is configured to support static website hosting.

Very good job. It is a good practice to create a great error document. This excellent [tutorial](https://www.portent.com/blog/seo/create-a-great-404-page.htm) talks about how to create a good error document and what are some good practices.

The bucket should allow public access. The S3 bucket has an IAM bucket policy that makes the bucket contents publicly accessible.

Nice work! I see from the screenshots that the permission settings are set up correctly. I can see the properties tab reflect the bucket Policy as Public.

## Website Distribution

CloudFront has been configured to retrieve and distribute website files.

Nice job! Your screenshot shows you have enabled distribution for your domain. The screenshot shows that the website is in the Cloud Distributions list.

## Web Browser Access

The website should be accessible to anyone on the Internet via a web browser. The student should have provided the CloudFront domain name URL and website-endpoint URL for the website.

Good work! I see that the website is available when I click on that link. I also see that the CloudFront endpoint URL is included in the CloudFront Distributions . The screenshot also shows that the state is Enabled.
