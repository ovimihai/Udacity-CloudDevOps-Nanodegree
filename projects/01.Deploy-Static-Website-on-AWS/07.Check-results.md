# Access Website in Web Browser

> **Note** - In the steps below, the exact domain name and the S3 URLs will be different in your case.

1. Open a web browser like Google Chrome, and paste the copied CloudFront domain name (such as, `dgf7z6g067r6d.cloudfront.net`) **without appending** `/index.html` at the end. The CloudFront domain name should show you the content of the default home-page, as shown below:

The figure above shows the page displayed at `https://dgf7z6g067r6d.cloudfront.net`

1. Access the website via website-endpoint, such as `http://<bucket-name>.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/`.
2. Access the bucket object via its S3 object URL, such as, `https://<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html`.

---

  
All three links: CloudFront domain name, S3 object URL, and website-endpoint will show you the same `index.html` content.
> 
> **If we were not "hosting" the website on S3, we could have made the bucket private and host the content only through the CloudFront domain name. In such a case, we cannot access the private content using S3 object URL and website-endpoint.**

### Troubleshooting Tip

1. After completing the project instructions, if you are unable to view the website contents, refer to the following guide: [I'm using an S3 website endpoint as the origin of my CloudFront distribution. Why am I getting 403 Access Denied errors?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-website-cloudfront-error-403/)
2. Refer to this official tutorial [Using a website endpoint as the origin, with anonymous (public) access allowed](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/), and verify if you have used the correct domain for your distribution. It should essentially be the **Static website hosting endpoint** of the form `<bucket-name>.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`.
