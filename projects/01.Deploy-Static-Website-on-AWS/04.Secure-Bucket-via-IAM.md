Go to the **Permissions** tab. See that the bucket allows public access for hosting.

1. The "Bucket Policy" section shows it is empty. Click on the Edit button.

Empty bucket policy. Check this policy again after setting up the CloudFront distribution.

1. Enter the following bucket policy replacing `your-website` with the name of your bucket and click "Save".
    
    { "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement":[ { "Sid":"AddPerm", "Effect":"Allow", "Principal": "*", "Action":["s3:GetObject"], "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::your-website/*"] } ] } 

You will see warnings about making your bucket public, but **this step is required for static website hosting.**

> **Note** - If we were not learning about static website hosting, we could have made the bucket private and wouldn't have to specify any bucket access policy explicitly. In such a case, once we set up the **CloudFront distribution**, it will automatically update the current bucket access policy to access the bucket content. The CloudFront service will make this happen by using the **Origin Access Identity** user.
