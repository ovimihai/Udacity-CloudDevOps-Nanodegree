**Our Final Stop**

### In this Lesson, We Will...

* Talk About the New Capabilities Monitoring Gives Us as Cloud Developers
* Discuss Some Monitoring Tools that are Available
* Talk about Prometheus
* Install and Configure Prometheus
* Talk About the Various Data Source Options and How to Get that Data into Prometheus
* Discuss How to Start Analyzing the Monitoring Data You Have
* Learn About Alerts and How to Set Them Up

### What Does Monitoring Feel Like?

Let's face it, monitoring is not that exciting! When you became an engineer, you probably didn't say "I can't wait to monitor _stuff_!". For many, it's like the matrix; there's so much information, it's like lines just blurring together! For others, it's not enough useful data. Plus, it's hard to get excited about something that seems to only brings bad news.

### What's the Reality?

* It's a necessary evil!
* Raise issues quickly and loudly.
* Best weapon against down-time.
* Often the most neglected or underestimated tool.

### What are the Possibilities?

* In the heat of battle, you'll get to problems faster.
* Find out when something goes down or degrades _(network logs)_.
* Wake up the right people in an event _(app logs)_.
* Find out an hour before an outage _(CPU, memory, disk)_.
* Use data to predict the next outage in 2 weeks _(ML, data science)_.

## Intuition About Monitoring

### A Needle in a Haystack?

As a cloud developer, during an outage, you should be able to know where to look to find the source of the problem. You should be able to see through a haystack of monitoring data and zero in on the issue at hand.

Before any outage, you should be thinking about where failures might occur and ensure those areas have proper monitoring. Some common areas where you might need monitoring are:

* Database Stats
* Application Logs
* Docker Logs
* Firewall
* Load Balancer
* GPU
* Operating System
* Router
* Cable Modem
* Message Bus
* AWS Services
* Mail Server
* Other 3rd Party Services
* Other Monitoring Systems

## The Case for Monitoring

### "But Monitoring Isn't Exciting!"

In case you need convincing, I'm going to give you a few reasons why monitoring is not an optional piece of your cloud development strategy.

![An image showing a straight line through a mess taking 5 minutes, and many stops through the mess taking 5 hours. This represents knowing where to look.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/June/5ef0d19d_001/001.png)

**It Helps To Find the Needle When You Have a (Metaphorical) Metal Detector**

### Availability
> 
> Uptime or downtime often translates to dollars, one way or the other. Downtime will increase drastically without monitoring since you won't be watching the system manually, round the clock. This downtime will negatively affect revenue or could increase legal costs.

### Performance
> 
> Company performance and image often hangs the reliability of its technology. If systems degrade when users are trying to consume it, their confidence in the system will also degrade, which might result in employee turn-over or loss of clients.

### Capacity
> 
> Company or product growth is (generally) a good thing, especially if technology can rise to the demands of its users. But, when infrastructure is not ready meet the needs of business on time, it can result in lost revenue or increased costs.

### Productivity
> 
> Development teams who spend time less troubleshooting tend to spend more time developing. However, without proper monitoring, development team members will have no choice but to dive into time-consuming troubleshooting, affecting feature release plans and incurring opportunity costs.

## Reactive vs Proactive

Reactive monitoring is common practice because of its usefulness during a crisis. But, monitoring can have even more power when used proactively.

### Reactive Monitoring

* Real time CPU, memory or disk space meters
* Current health status of any server or resource
* Application logs
* Operating System logs

### Proactive Monitoring

* Forecast Infrastructure Costs
* Monitor the Unknowns
* Track Bugs to Their True Source
* Predict Seasonal Spikes and Trends

### Convinced yet?

If you're interested in learning more about Data Science and gain new capabilities to utilize your monitoring data, I highly recommend the [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

Monitoring isn't important until it is. It's not interesting or exciting until it is. If you're still not convinced, you have to trust me. Just do it.

## Monitoring Tools

### Any Complete Monitoring System will be Composed of:

#### 1\. Time-Series Data

**Time-series data** is data that is in a series of time intervals. Some examples include:

* Blood-sugar level checked at the top of every hour
* Daily closing value of Microsoft stock
* Monthly rainfall by city
* Available disk space by the minute

Another way I like to describe time-series data is "anything with a timestamp and at least 10 data points." Therefore, data collected from your monitoring system is time-series data!

#### 2\. Data Aggregator

A **data aggregator** is a system that collects and groups data by type or data source. One way to think of data aggregators is like a database with extra tooling to aid in data collection.

#### 3\. Data Visualizer

A **data visualizer** takes copious amounts of seemingly unintelligible data from the data aggregator and produces useful charts and graphs.
