### Pipeline Values

Circle CI has a handful of values that might come in handy.

| Value                    | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| pipeline.id              | The ID of the currently running pipeline                     |
| pipeline.number          | An alternative numeric ID for the currently running pipeline |
| pipeline.project.git_url | The URL of the triggering git event (ex: pull request URL)   |
| pipeline.project.type    | Example: “github”                                            |
| pipeline.git.branch      | The branch triggering the pipeline                           |

You can use them almost anywhere in your jobs with a simple syntax:
    
    My pipeline id is << pipeline.id >> and my git branch is << pipeline.git.branch >>. 

Note: Pipeline values cannot be used outside the job context. For example, you cannot use these in a shell script.

### Environment Variables

And, of course, we can use environment variables throughout the system as well. Some env vars are defined by us, others are built-in to the circle ci environment. All env vars are bound to a scope.

#### Environment Variable Scopes

| Scope        | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Organization | Organizations contain projects, so env vars set at this level will be available to all child projects. Great for organization-wide keys, for example.                              |
| Project      | Projects contain pipeline jobs, so env vars set the project level are available to all jobs in the project but are not to jobs that belong to other projects.                      |
| Job          | Environment variables that are set inside the job are only available to that job. You can either set env vars using the environment map or by exporting them using shell commands. |

#### Built-In Environment Variables

Circle CI comes loaded with many built-in environment variables that can be almost anywhere. Some built-in env vars are equal to or very similar to the pipeline above. But there are many more that go beyond just pipeline values.

**Environment Variable****Description**

`CIRCLE_BRANCH`The name of the Git branch currently being built

`CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID`A unique identifier for the workflow instance of the current job

`CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM`The number of the CircleCI build

`CIRCLE_PR_NUMBER`The number of the associated GitHub or Bitbucket pull request

`CIRCLE_SHA1`The SHA1 hash of the last commit of the current build

#### Further Reading:

* Read through the env variables that are available in [Circle CI docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/).


## Exercise: Environment Variables

Configure project-level environment variables.

### Instructions:

1. Create a new project in Circle CI or use an existing project
2. Go to your project's settings and navigate to "Environment Variables". For a hint about where to find this, check out the [docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).
3. Add an environment variable with your name as the value.
4. Add a job to the project's pipeline that prints your name to the console using the environment variable. If you'd like, you can even use the example `.circleci/config.yml` in the [docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project) as your template.

### Solution

Your code should look similar to this:
    
```yaml
version: 2.1

workflows:
  test-env-vars:
    jobs:
      - build

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2020.01
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "echo an env var that is part of our project"
          command: |
            echo $MY_ENV_VAR
