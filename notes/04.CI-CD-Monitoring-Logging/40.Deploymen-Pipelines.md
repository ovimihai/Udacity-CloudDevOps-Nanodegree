**Halfway Through!**

### In this Lesson, We Will...

* Learn what Configuration Management Tools are and How to Use Them
* Design an Ansible Playbook

* Build an Ansible Inventory File
* Make Various Types of CD Jobs in our CI/CD Pipeline
  * Create Infrastructure
  * Configure Infrastructure
  * Deploy Production Artifacts
  * Smoke Testing
  * Rollback

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment can be an incredible tool in your arsenal. Not only does CD save time, but it opens some unexpected doors that have a ripple effect over the entire organization. Let's take a look at where CD fits into the overall **S**oftware **D**evelopment **L**ife**c**ycle.

#### Where does CD fit in the SDLC?

* While CI is all about code, CD is all about the deployment of the artifact.
* CI produces the artifact, whether it's a docker image, a zip file, or an executable.
* CD Validates the artifact, builds the infrastructure needed to run it, and sets the artifact in motion.
* CD affects earlier stages of development over time because team members see quick deployments and begin slicing features into smaller pieces to take advantage.

**Time to Deploy!**

#### What will I need to add CD?

* Buy in from decision-makers.
* Automation skills, which you are learning in this course.
* Access to servers or cloud resources.
* Time to build automation.

#### What will I lose when I add CD?

* The ability to tinker with the servers manually.
* The opaque wall of secrecy around one dev's way of deploying.
* Free pizza from the deployment all-nighters.

#### What will I gain when I have CD?

* Automated deployments to QA, Staging, Prod.
* More time to develop features.
* Generate more confidence amongst stakeholders.

## Continuous Delivery Intuition

As you get to know CD pipelines in general, you'll eventually develop some intuition about how healthy your CD pipeline is or is not. You'll also be able to easily spot problem areas and be able to explain how they impact the whole process.

Whether you're still waiting on that intuition to form or if you've had it for a long time, it's helpful to have metrics to guide decisions and demonstrate impact empirically.

### Healthy Continuous Delivery

Let's take a look at a few metrics I use when I want to demonstrate the level of health or impact of a CD pipeline:

| Metric                  | Formula                                                                         | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lead Time to Production | (Time at Successful Prod Deployment) - (Time at Completion of Feature Grooming) | Shows how CI/CD is impacting overall delivery time, from the point the team hears about the feature to the point at which it is done (deployed to production). Easy metric to collect if using task management system to track feature grooming and deployments. |
| Rollback Rate           | (Total Rollbacks) / (Total Deployments)                                         | Shows the quality of our deployments. Of course, rate should be low because previous stages should filter out defected builds. This metric is a leading indicator for the confidence of the business in the dev team's ability to delivery.                      |
| Time to Failure         | (Time at Failure Discovery) - (Time at Build Start)                             | Shows how quickly we find failures. The lower the better.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Production Uptime       | (Total Production Working Time) / (Total Time)                                  | Shows the amount of time we are taking production down because of botched deployments or due to our chosen deployment strategy.                                                                                                                                  |
| Failed Pipeline Cost    | Various calculations including job run time and resources created               | Shows the estimated amount of money spent on a failed build. Encourages us to put cheaper jobs earlier in the pipeline.                                                                                                                                          |
