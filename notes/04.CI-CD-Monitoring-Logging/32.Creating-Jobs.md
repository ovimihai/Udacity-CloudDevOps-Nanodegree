## Anatomy of a Job
Remember that a job is where we define the work that needs to get done.

| Job Option  | Description                                                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <job_name>  | The name of the job which shows up in the Circle CI web app.             |
| environment | Map of environment variables.                                            |
| docker      | Docker image in which to run the job.                                    |
| branches    | Rules to decide when to run this job by branch exclusions or inclusions. |
| steps       | Instructions to execute in the job.                                      |

## Docker Images
When you are designing your jobs, you'll need to think about what docker image you want to use each time. If you're like me, you will have a handful of favorites. Each docker image comes pre-loaded with utilities and packages you need for different situations.

| Image             | Use                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| circleci/node     | For Node.JS server-side and networking applications.  |
| circleci/postgres | For tasks that require PostgreSQL database functions. |
| circleci/python   | For job that need to run Python or pip.               |
| alpine:latest     | A lightweight container for simple tasks.             |
| amazon/aws-cli    | For tasks that require the AWS CLI and related tools. |

## Types of Steps
Think of the steps in a job as a task list. Each step will perform some instructions and then we move on to the next step until they've all been executed. Each step has a type that defines how it will be run or represents an alias that points to another set of steps.

| Step Type                                 | Description                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| checkout                                  | Checks out the source code. Common to have this in all jobs in CI.                                                 |
| run                                       | Runs a shell command. Can name the step or simply execute a script.                                                |
| when                                      | A conditional step that has its own steps that are run if the condition is true.                                   |
| save_cache and restore_cache              | Save and restore files or folders. Cleaned up after pipeline finishes.                                             |
| persist_to_workspace and attach_workspace | Like a cache, but files are available for 15 days after pipeline.                                                  |
| add_ssh_keys                              | Adding some additional ssh keys to the job for a tool that needs them (i.e. Ansible).                              |
| store_artifacts                           | Makes an artifact, or file, available for download via CircleCI web app or API.                                    |
| store_test_results                        | Stores test results from test runner so that results are visible in Circle CI web app in the Test Summary section. |
| "Orbs"                                    | Orbs, which we talked about already, are used like step types.                                                     |
