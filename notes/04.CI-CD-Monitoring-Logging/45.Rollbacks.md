## Rollback Jobs

### When the Smoke Tests Fail

Dare I mention confidence again? If smoke tests are about building confidence, rollbacks are about preserving it! Rollback jobs are an essential part of any mature CI/CD pipeline. Rollbacks give you the ability to hit CTRL-Z on all the changes you made during CI/CD and protect your stakeholders' confidence by failing gracefully.

**Uh Oh, Time to Roll Everything Back!**

### What Do I Need for This Job?

1. A reusable command to handle the work of destroying the green infrastructure.
2. In the command, a step to delete the stack using whatever name we defined when creating the stack.
3. A job with an image that can handle AWS CLI commands.
4. A step that simulates a failed smoke test or any other failure (exit with non-zero).
5. A step that uses our reusable command with a condition to run only when something failed.
6. A workflow that runs our job.

## Exercise: Rollback

In this exercise, you will write a reusable command that rolls back changes. The current exercise is in continuation to the previous Exercise: Config and Deployment.

### Prerequisites

1. **Key pair** - You should have an AWS EC2 key pair. We are assuming the key pair name is **udacity.pem**.

1. **EC2 Ubuntu instance** - You should have an EC2 Ubuntu instance running in your AWS account.

1. **CircleCI project** - A public Github repository set up in the [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/). AWS Access keys and EC2 key pair (SSH key) must have saved in the CircleCI project settings.

1. You should have finished the previous:
  * **Exercise: Remote Control Using Ansible**,
  * **Exercise: Infrastructure Creation**, and
  * **Exercise: Config and Deployment**,

and have the following files in your repo and local:
    
```
└── template.yml
└── .circleci
    └─── config.yml        
```

2. Ensure to have CloudFormation template named `template.yml` that will create some infrastructure. This should be checked into your git repo. You can use your own from previous lessons or you can try this example:

```
Resources:
  Ec2Instance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Properties:
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref InstanceSecurityGroup
      KeyName: udacity
      ImageId: 'ami-068663a3c619dd892'
  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup'
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable SSH access via port 22
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: '22'
          ToPort: '22'
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
```

**Ensure that the `KeyName` and `ImageID` are correct.**

### Instructions

In this exercise, you will work in the "commands" section of the CircleCI config file. There may be many places where we want to rollback your changes. That means we need a "command" so that we can reuse the code.

1. Add a command to your Circle CI config file called `destroy_environments`. This command should use [cloudformation delete-stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/delete-stack.html) to delete the stack that the job previously created. It wil look like:

```
commands:
   # Exercise - Rollback
   destroy_environment:
     steps:
       - run:
           name: Destroy environment
           # ${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID} is a Built-in environment variable 
           # ${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:5} takes the first 5 chars of the variable CIRCLE_CI_WORKFLOW_ID 
           when: on_fail
           command: |
             aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name myStack-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7}
```    

2. Write a `create_infrastructure` job that creates a new stack using the template you just created.
    
```
# Exercise - Rollback
create_infrastructure: 
 docker:
   - image: amazon/aws-cli
 steps:
   - checkout
   - run:
       name: Create Cloudformation Stack
       command: |
         aws cloudformation deploy \
           --template-file template.yml \
           --stack-name myStack-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7} \
           --region us-east-1
```

1. Make your `smoke_test` (or anyone else) job fail intentionally after CloudFormation creates the stack. You can simply add a step that says `return 1` to simulate an error. Call your `destroy_environments` command. The job will look like:
    
```
# Exercise: Smoke Testing
smoke_test:
 docker:
   - image: alpine:latest
 steps:
   - run:
       name: Test job
       # Fail the job intentionally to simulate an error.
       command:  return 1
   - destroy_environment  
```

1. Add the two jobs above in the workflows section, and comment out the previous jobs. It will save you some build time.

1. After your pipeline executes successfully, you should be able to verify the stack was created and then deleted. In the end, you should have no additional stacks in your AWS CloudFormation console.
