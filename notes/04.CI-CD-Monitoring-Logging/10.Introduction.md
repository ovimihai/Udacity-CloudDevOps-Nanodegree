## Prerequisites

Here's what you'll need to stay afloat in this course:

* Experience with Front-End Development using HTML5 and JavaScript
* Experience with Version Control using Git
* Experience with Back-End Development of an Application in AWS
* Linux Command Line Basics
* Ability to Create a Key-Pair from EC2

You'll also need accounts in Github, Circle CI and AWS.

## Introduction to Continuous Delivery

There is some confusion in the community around Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. For the sake of consistency throughout this course, we will assume that Continuous Delivery is an overarching paradigm or mindset that informs and enhances the practices of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

![The relationship between continuous integration, delivery, and deployment depicted in *this* course.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/June/5ed80bf7_image-2020-06-03-at-3.45.21-pm/image-2020-06-03-at-3.45.21-pm.png)

However, there are other definitions of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment present in the industry, as:

* [What is Continuous Delivery?](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/) - by AWS
* [Continuous integration vs. continuous delivery vs. continuous deployment](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment) - by Atlassian
* [An Introduction to Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment) - by DigitalOcean

Although there is some inconsistency in the definition of CI/CD across different platforms, by the end of the course, you will realize that CI/CD is a set of development practices aimed at automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

## Continuous Delivery Is Important

Devops, Agile, Lean, Kanban, Scrum... all great things, all exciting buzz words, each the subject of many conferences, blogs and courses. But, not a single one of those amazing concepts or methodologies will make a real difference until we allow them to change how we think about the value we deliver to our customers.

Continuous Delivery doesn't replace anything, but rather it enhances everything.

**Use CD to Add Value**

## Stakeholders

Both sides of the business/tech divide need to involve the other side in decisions so that our companies can be stronger and make a better impact on the world. But, since you're the one taking this course, it's probably going to be up to you to start the conversation. You can start by bringing your business leaders into the discussion about CI/CD and Continuous Delivery.

Use this as an opportunity to translate the technical terms into words that matter to the business-minded people in your company. Convince them to move in the direction of Continuous Delivery based on the very real benefits it can have for your company, not just some cool technical features that make developers happy. By bringing the business side of the house into the discussion, you'll be better positioned to make real change!

**We Need to Translate CI/CD Concepts into Words Our Stakeholders Can Understand**

## Continuous Delivery as a "True North"

https://youtu.be/9kauLHdeZ6k

### A Better "True North"

True continuous delivery is not always attainable for the long term. That doesn't negate its usefulness as a "True North", though. If we keep continuous delivery as our "eventual destination", then every small improvement in that direction will be a win.

### Building Confidence

In order to achieve (or even move in the direction of) continuous delivery, we need to pay attention to the confidence of our stakeholders. The confidence they have in the delivery team to do its job well, the more freedom the delivery team will have to move closer to continuous delivery.

Stakeholders need confidence that...

* Production will be available for users
* Features will be built correctly

Once they have that, frequent, automated deliveries straight to production **should** be no problem.

### Exercises to Build Confidence and Move Closer to Continuous Delivery

* Expect collaborative, comprehensive grooming of features that include team and stakeholders
* Ruthless slicing of features to smallest valuable increments
* Build team-wide, deep understanding of each feature's requirements and characteristics before coding starts
* Write comprehensive automated unit tests in front-end and back-end layers
* Shoot for high coverage from automated back-end integration tests
* Shoot for high feature critical-path coverage from end-to-end UI tests
* Include automated smoke tests that can be run on production-candidates
* Ensure all post-commit tasks and hand-offs must be automated in CI/CD
* Strive for quick, reliable rollback if smoke tests fail

5. Build-in Quality
6. "Done" Means Released
7. Everyone is Responsible
8. Continuous Improvement

If you'd like to get deeper into Continuous Delivery, I recommend you read ["Continuous Delivery"by Jez Humble and David Farley](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20) (**ISBN-13**: 978-0321601919, **ISBN-10**: 9780321601919).
