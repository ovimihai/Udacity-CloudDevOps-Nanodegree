## Production Candidate Promotion Jobs

https://youtu.be/a0SGXkxmKwg

### Promoting to Production

Promoting a new version in a Blue Green Deployment is the same as "switching the router" from the old to the new version. In some cases, the switch is fairly straightforward. In other cases, you might need to have some extra information about the old and new deployments so that you can inform the router of properly. In the case of my examples, we need the S3 Bucket's name so that we can configure CloudFront with a new "[origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_Origin.html)".

**We Did It! Time to Promote!**

This is it! We've got our green production version humming, smoke tests have passed, confidence is high... it's time to make the switch!

### What Do I Need for This Job?

1. A previous job named resources with the workflow ID so that it's easy to refer to them later. For example, if we want to create an S3 bucket:
    
```
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file bucket.yml \
  --stack-name "${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}" \
  --parameter-overrides NAME="${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}"
```

And copy the web files to the bucket:
    
```
run: aws s3 sync . s3://"${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}" --delete
```

2. An image that can handle AWS CLI.
3. An existing CloudFront distribution, created by CloudFormation so that it has a stack. The origin should be the old production version S3 Bucket.
4. A CloudFormation template that can update an existing CloudFront stack with a new "origin".
5. A job to execute the CloudFormation template to switch from blue to green, like this:

```
aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file cloudfront.yml \
    --stack-name cloudfront \
    --parameter-overrides PipelineID="${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}"
```

## Exercise: Promote to Production

Write a set of jobs that promotes a new environment to production and decommissions the old environment in an automated process.

### Prerequisites

You should have finished the previous:

* Exercise: Remote Control Using Ansible,
* Exercise: Infrastructure Creation,
* Exercise: Config and Deployment, and
* Exercise: Rollback

## Instructions

There are a few manual steps we need to take to "prime the pump". These manual steps enable steps that will be automated later.

### Step 1\. Create an S3 bucket (Manually)

* Create a **public** S3 Bucket (e.g., _mybucket644752792305_) manually. If you need help with this, follow the instructions found in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html).

* Create a simple HTML page (version 1) and name it `index.html`. It could be as simple as:
    
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
      <title>Version 1</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h1>Hello World - version 1</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Upload the _index.html_ page to your bucket. Follow these [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html#upload-website-content) if you need help. Make sure you can browse to the home page.

* Enable the Static website hosting in that bucket and set _index.html_ as default page of the website. See the snapshot below.

![Enable the Static website hosting](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/September/612f92ed_screenshot-2021-08-31-at-12.22.33-pm/screenshot-2021-08-31-at-12.22.33-pm.png)

Enable the Static website hosting

### Step 2\. Create a Cloudformation Stack (Manually)

* Use a Cloudformation template to create a [Cloudfront Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-distribution.html), and later in this exercise, use the same template to modify the Cloudfront distribution.
> 
> Confused between Cloudformation (IaC) vs Cloudfront (CDN)? We encourage you to read the basic definition from the official docs.

Cloudformation is a service that allows creating any AWS resource using the YAML template files. In other words, it supports Infrastructure as a Code (IaC). Cloudfront is a network of servers that **caches** the content, such as website media, geographically close to consumers. Cloudfront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service.

* Create a Cloudformation template file named `cloudfront.yml` with the following contents:
    
```
Parameters:
# Existing Bucket name
PipelineID:
  Description: Existing Bucket name
  Type: String
Resources:
    CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity:
      Type: "AWS::CloudFront::CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity"
      Properties:
        CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig:
          Comment: Origin Access Identity for Serverless Static Website
    WebpageCDN:
      Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
      Properties:
        DistributionConfig:
          Origins:
            - DomainName: !Sub "${PipelineID}.s3.amazonaws.com"
              Id: webpage
              S3OriginConfig:
                OriginAccessIdentity: !Sub "origin-access-identity/cloudfront/${CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity}"
          Enabled: True
          DefaultRootObject: index.html
          DefaultCacheBehavior:
            ForwardedValues:
              QueryString: False
            TargetOriginId: webpage
            ViewerProtocolPolicy: allow-all
  Outputs:
    PipelineID:
      Value: !Sub ${PipelineID}
      Export:
        Name: PipelineID
```

The file above is also available [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/cloudfront.yml) and it creates a Cloudfront Distribution that will connect to the existing bucket.

* Execute the _cloudfront.yml_ template above with the following command:

```
aws cloudformation deploy \
--template-file cloudfront.yml \
--stack-name production-distro \
--parameter-overrides PipelineID="${S3_BUCKET_NAME}" \ # Name of the S3 bucket you created manually.
--tags project=udapeople &
```    

In the command above, replace `${S3_BUCKET_NAME}` with the actual name of your bucket (e.g., _mybucket644752792305_). Also, note down the stack name - `production-distro` for the future. You will need the _cloudfront.yml_ file in the automation steps later again.

![Execute the *cloudfront.yml* template file that will create a CloudFront distribution (CDN) based on the bucket name mentioned against `PipelineID` parameter](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/September/612f9315_screenshot-2021-08-31-at-12.32.52-pm/screenshot-2021-08-31-at-12.32.52-pm.png)

Execute the _cloudfront.yml_ template file that will create a CloudFront distribution (CDN) based on the bucket name mentioned against `PipelineID` parameter

### Step 3\. Cloudformation template to create a new S3 bucket
> 
> Caveat: Copy-pasting the YAML code below will break the indentation! Fix the indentation hierarchy before you push your updates to your Github repo.

* Create another Cloudformation template named `bucket.yml` that will create a **new bucket** and bucket policy. You can use the following template:
    
```
Parameters:
# New Bucket name
MyBucketName:
  Description: Existing Bucket name
  Type: String
Resources:
WebsiteBucket:
  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
  Properties:
    BucketName: !Sub "${MyBucketName}"
    AccessControl: PublicRead
    WebsiteConfiguration:
      IndexDocument: index.html
      ErrorDocument: error.html
WebsiteBucketPolicy:
  Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
  Properties:
    Bucket: !Ref 'WebsiteBucket'
    PolicyDocument:
      Statement:
      - Sid: PublicReadForGetBucketObjects
        Effect: Allow
        Principal: '*'
        Action: s3:GetObject
        Resource: !Join ['', ['arn:aws:s3:::', !Ref 'WebsiteBucket', /*]]
```

The file above is also available [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/bucket.yml).

### Step 4\. Update the CircleCI Config file

* **Job** - Write a job named `create_and_deploy_front_end` that executes the `bucket.yml` template to:
  1. Create a new S3 bucket and
  2. Copy the contents of the current repo (production files) to the new bucket.

Your job should look like this:
    
```
# Executes the bucket.yml - Deploy an S3 bucket, and interface with that bucket to synchronize the files between local and the bucket.
# Note that the `--parameter-overrides` let you specify a value that override parameter value in the bucket.yml template file.
create_and_deploy_front_end:
docker:
 - image: amazon/aws-cli
steps:
 - checkout
 - run:
     name: Execute bucket.yml - Create Cloudformation Stack
     command: |
       aws cloudformation deploy \
       --template-file bucket.yml \
       --stack-name stack-create-bucket-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7} \
       --parameter-overrides MyBucketName="mybucket-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7}"
 # Uncomment the step below if yoou wish to upload all contents of the current directory to the S3 bucket
  - run: aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7} --delete
```

    * Please be mindful of the indentation. The job is also avilable in this [file](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml).
    * Notice we are passing in the CIRCLE\_WORKFLOW\_ID in `mybucket-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7}` to help form the name of our new bucket. This helps us to reference the bucket later, in another job/command.
    * Once this job runs successfully, it will change the cache in the CDN to the new _index.html_, which is also present [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/index.html).

* Towards the end of this exercise, we need another job for deleting the S3 bucket created manually (cleaning up after promotion). For this purpose, you need to know which pipeline ID was responsible for creating the S3 bucket created manually (the last successful production release). We can query Cloudformation for the old pipeline ID information.

* **Job** - Write a CircleCI job named `get_last_deployment_id` that performs the query and saves the id to a file that we can persist to the workspace. For convenience, here's the job that you can use:
    
```
# Fetch and save the pipeline ID (bucket ID) responsible for the last release.
get_last_deployment_id:
  docker:
    - image: amazon/aws-cli
  steps:
    - checkout
    - run: yum install -y tar gzip
    - run:
        name: Fetch and save the old pipeline ID (bucket name) responsible for the last release.
        command: |
          aws cloudformation \
          list-exports --query "Exports[?Name==\`PipelineID\`].Value" \
          --no-paginate --output text > ~/textfile.txt
    - persist_to_workspace:
        root: ~/
        paths: 
          - textfile.txt 
```

In the job above, we are saving the bucket ID to a file and persist the file to the workspace for other jobs to access.

* **Job** - Write a job named `promote_to_production` that executes our `cloudfront.yml` CloudFormation template used in the manual steps. Here's the job you can use:
    
```
# Executes the cloudfront.yml template that will modify the existing CloudFront Distribution, change its target from the old bucket to the new bucket - `mybucket-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7}`. 
# Notice here we use the stack name `production-distro` which is the same name we used while deploying to the S3 bucket manually.
promote_to_production:
  docker:
    - image: amazon/aws-cli
  steps:
    - checkout
    - run:
        name: Execute cloudfront.yml
        command: |
          aws cloudformation deploy \
          --template-file cloudfront.yml \
          --stack-name production-distro \
          --parameter-overrides PipelineID="mybucket-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:7}"
``` 

Notice here we use the stack name `production-distro` which is the same name we used in the throw-away Cloudformation template above.

* **Job** - Write a Job Named `clean_up_old_front_end` that uses the pipeline ID to destroy the previous production version's S3 bucket and CloudFormation stack. To achieve this, you need to retrieve from the workspace the file where the previous Pipeline ID was stored. Once you have the Pipeline ID, use the following commands to clean up:
    
```
# Destroy the previous production version's S3 bucket and CloudFormation stack. 
clean_up_old_front_end:
  docker:
    - image: amazon/aws-cli
  steps:
    - checkout
    - run: yum install -y tar gzip
    - attach_workspace:
        at: ~/
    - run:
        name: Destroy the previous S3 bucket and CloudFormation stack. 
        # Use $OldBucketID environment variable or mybucket644752792305 below.
        # Similarly, you can create and use $OldStackID environment variable in place of production-distro 
        command: |
          export OldBucketID=$(cat ~/textfile.txt)
          aws s3 rm "s3://${OldBucketID}" --recursive
```

* **Workflow** - Define a Workflow that puts these jobs in order. Comment out the jobs that are not part of this exercise. Try to keep the workflow minimal. Your workflow will look as:
    
```
workflows:
    my_workflow:
      jobs:
        - create_and_deploy_front_end
        - promote_to_production:
            requires: 
              - create_and_deploy_front_end
        - get_last_deployment_id
        - clean_up_old_front_end:
            requires:
              - get_last_deployment_id
              - promote_to_production
```

* Push your code to the Github repo, and it will trigger the CircleCI build pipeline. If successful, your pipeline workflow will look like as shown in the snapshot below.

![Successful workflow in the CircleCI](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618d3ca0_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-9.22.05-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-9.22.05-pm.png)

Successful workflow in the CircleCI

### Step 5\. Verify after upto 30 mins

* Verify version 2 is browsable using Cloudfront domain name. Note that the AWS Cloudfront takes upto 30 mins to create caches and show the updated web page.

![Website after promoting the CDN to the new *index.html* file](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618d3d00_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-9.23.15-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-9.23.15-pm.png)

Website after promoting the CDN to the new _index.html_ file

* In some cases, depending upon your geographical location, it may take upto 24 hours to update the Cloudfront CDN. See an excerpt from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serving-outdated-content-s3/).
> 
> By default, CloudFront caches a response from Amazon S3 for 24 hours (Default TTL of 86,400 seconds). If your request lands at an edge location that served the Amazon S3 response within 24 hours, then CloudFront uses the cached response even if you updated the content in Amazon S3\.

* Clean up after the verification. Delete the cloudformation stack and the S3 bucket(s).

## Solution: Promote to Production

### Solution

**Prerequisite**:

* An S3 bucket (say `mybucket644752792305` or choose another name) containing a sample `index.html` file created manually in your AWS console.
* Enable the Static website hosting in that bucket.
* Use the command below to create a CloudFront Distribution manually
    
```
aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file cloudfront.yml \
    --stack-name production-distro \
    --parameter-overrides PipelineID="mybucket644752792305"
```

In the command above, the `PipelineID` refers to the bucket name.

Solution files relevant for this exercise are:
    
```
├── bucket.yml          # Creates a new bucket and bucket policy.       
├── cloudfront.yml      # Creates a Cloudfront Distribution that will connect to the new bucket created above.
├── error.html
├── index.html  
└── .circleci
  └── config.yml
```

Look for the following four Jobs:
  * create\_and\_deploy\_front\_end,
  * get\_last\_deployment\_id,
  * promote\_to\_production, and
  * clean\_up\_old\_front\_end

> Important: Delete all your AWS resources - EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and CloudFormation stacks once you finish the exercises in this lesson, or you plan to move away for a while.
