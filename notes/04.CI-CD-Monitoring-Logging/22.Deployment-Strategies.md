| Deployment Strategy | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Big-Bang            | Replace A with B all at once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Blue Green          | Two versions of production: Blue or previous version and Green or new version. Traffic can still be routed to blue while testing green. Switching to the new version is done by simply shifting traffic from blue to green.                                  |
| Canary              | Aka Rolling Update, After deploying the new version, start routing traffic to new version little by little until all traffic is hitting the new production. Both versions coexist for a period of time.                                                      |
| A/B Testing         | Similar to Canary, but instead of routing traffic to new version to accomplish a full deployment, you are testing your new version with a subset of users for feedback. You might end up routing all traffic to the new version, but that's always the goal. |

## Blue Green Deployment

### Router

| Router Option | Description                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Load Balancer | Instant switch for FE or BE, ideal router in most cases |
| CDN           | Instant switch for front-end web apps.                  |
| DNS           | A bit slow because of DNS propagation.                  |

| Integrate Code in a Build        | Compile and create artifact                                              |
| Run Tests                        | Run unit and/or integration tests                                        |
| Ensure Infrastructure is Present | Create green infrastructure                                              |
| Provision the Environment        | Configure green instance, migrate DB, etc                                |
| Deploy Artifact                  | Copy artifact files to instance                                          |
| Run Smoke Tests                  | Run a few tests that don't impact the prod server                        |
| Perform Rollback if Failure      | Rollback here is more of a cleanup of green                              |
| Switch Router                    | Redirect traffic to new version                                          |
| Run Sanity Test                  | Run a few tests that don't impact the prod server                        |
| Perform Rollback If Failure      | Rollback here is switching the router back to blue and cleaning up green |
| Destroy Old Release Environment? | Clean up blue envÂ (optional)                                             |
