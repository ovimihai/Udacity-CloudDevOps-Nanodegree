### Best Practices for CI/CD:

#### Fail Fast

Set up your CI/CD pipeline to find and reveal failures as fast as possible. The faster you can bring your code failures to light, the faster you can fix them.

#### Measure Quality

Measure your code quality so that you can see the positive effects of your improvement work (or the negative effects of technical debt).

#### Only Road to Production

Once CI/CD is deploying to production on your behalf, it must be the only way to deploy. Any other person or process that meddles with production after CI/CD is running will inevitably cause CI/CD to become inconsistent and fail.

#### Maximum Automation

If it can be automated, automate it. This will only improve your process!

#### Config in Code

All configuration code must be in code and versioned alongside your production code. This includes the CI/CD configuration files!
