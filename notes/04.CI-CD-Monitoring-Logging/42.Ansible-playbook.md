# Design an Ansible Playbook

https://youtu.be/BB5aKlsYfo0

The command used in the demo above is similar to:
    
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt main.yml --private-key=~/udacity-ansible.pem 

Before you use the command above, go through the section below and change the name and path of the private key filename - _udacity-ansible.pem_.

## Ansible Playbook - Introduction
> 
> **Definition** - Playbooks are the YAML files containing a series of commands to run on the target machines.

Each Playbook contains the following primary sections:

* name - Name of the file.
* hosts - Identifies the target machines / hosts.
* tasks - Contains the ordered series of commands to run on the identified hosts. Sometimes, it contains Modules, which are like library functions.
* roles - These are self-conatined "child" Playbooks that are used to bring modularity in complex orchestration.

See an exmaple Playbook in the demo video below. You'll be creating lots of Playbooks from here on out! They're a large part of using Ansible to implement Continuous Delivery.

### 1\. Install Ansible

Refer to the official instructions available [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

### 2\. Authentication

Remember that Ansible is just executing bash commands over SSH, so whatever you need to log in to your instance manually, you will also need for Ansible.

There are two things we need to authenticate:

1. username
2. ssh key

The first component of authentication is the "username" of the user we will log in as. In most cases, you will use the default user for the EC2 instance. For example, if your instance was created using the Ubuntu AMI, then your default username is "ubuntu" according to [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html).
    
     user: ubuntu 

The second component of authentication is the SSH key, also known as the key pair or the PEM file. The SSH key would have been associated with our default user already. We need a copy of the SSH key in the form of a PEM file. We will refer to this PEM file when executing the playbook.

### 3\. Targets

You can target one or more machines with just one Ansible playlist. Each play in a Playbook should have a `hosts` section where you can select machines that you want to configure. You can specify one hostname, a group name, or use a pattern to select multiple hosts from an inventory list.
    
     hosts: web 

An inventory file can be very powerful and complex, but it can also be extremely simple. On the easy extreme, the inventory file is just a list of DNS hostnames or IP addresses in a group labeled by a `["group_name"]` in typical INI style. This is what it looks like.
    
    [web] ec2-50-16-166-50.compute-1.amazonaws.com 

Note that the `web` group name is being referred to in the Playbook `host` line. Have a look at the relevant references:

* [How to target different hosts?](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html)
* [How to build an inventory file?](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

### 4\. Roles

In Ansible, roles are a great way to clean up your Ansible code and make it more maintainable. We can build roles by using Ansible's expected folder/file structure.
    
    ├── main1.yml      # Playbook file (Ignore file name)
    └── roles
        ├── configure-prometheus-node-exporter
        │   └── tasks
        │       └── main.yml
        └── configure-server
                └── tasks
                    └── main.yml

The main playbook file and configure-server role files above also available here: [https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution) Here we have two roles:

1. configure-prometheus-node-exporter
2. configure-server\`

The sub-folders in each role folder represent a different function in the role:

| Role Component | Description                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| tasks          | Main list of tasks that the role executes               |
| files          | Files that the role deploys                             |
| handlers       | Handlers, which may be used within or outside this role |
| library        | Modules, which may be used within this role             |
| defaults       | Default variables for the role                          |
| vars           | Other variables for the role                            |
| templates      | Templates that the role deploys                         |
| meta           | Metadata for the role, including role dependencies      |

According to Ansible's rules, each sub-folder of each role must have a `main.yml` file in it, which is how it is able to discover and incorporate the role functionality.

We're going to mostly use `tasks` and `files`. If you want to know more about how to use the other components of Ansible roles, you should check out the docs.

Let's take a look at my task code.

Our `main.yml` playbook file:
    
    ---
    - name: "configuration play."
    hosts: web
    user: ubuntu
    gather_facts: false
    vars:
        - ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
        - ansible_host_key_checking: false
        - ansible_stdout_callback: yaml

    pre_tasks:
        - name: "wait 600 seconds for target connection to become reachable/usable."
        wait_for_connection:

        - name: "install python for Ansible."
        become: true
        raw: test -e /usr/bin/python3 || (apt -y update && apt install -y python3)
        changed_when: false

        - setup:
    roles:
        - configure-prometheus-node-exporter
        - configure-server1

> Be careful with the indentation of the YAML file above! It is possible that the indentation may get disturbed while copying-pasting.

You can find the main playbook file in the [Github](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/main1.yml). _(Ignore the file name)._

Our `roles/configure-server/tasks/main.yml` file _(Roles)_:
    
    ---
    - name: "upgrade packages."
    become: true
    apt:
        upgrade: "yes"

    - name: "install dependencies."
    become: true
    apt:
        name: ["nodejs", "npm"]
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes

    - name: "install pm2"
    become: true
    npm:
        name: pm2
        global: yes
        production: yes
        state: present

The role file above can also be found here on [Github](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/roles/configure-server/tasks/main.yml). Do not copy and use it straight-away. Instead, go through the individual statements. In my code above, you'll notice a few things:

* The playbook is the entry point
* The playbook delegates to roles by name
* The role does the actual work. You can probably guess what it's doing without much explanation.
* Each task is using `become: yes` to escalate to `root` user (like adding `sudo` before bash commands).

### 5\. Modules

Ansible modules are the utilities that you can use in your Playbooks. Some of the Ansible modules are:

| Module    | Description                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| shell     | How you execute shell commands and scripts                |
| apt       | Manage apt packages                                       |
| npm       | Manage nodejs packages                                    |
| file      | Set attributes of files and directories as well as remove |
| git       | Push and pull code and files from git                     |
| script    | Execute a shell script                                    |
| copy      | Copy files                                                |
| unarchive | Unpack an archive file                                    |
| systemd   | Manage services                                           |

You can see a list of all the modules in [the Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_all_modules.html).

## Exercise: Define Ansible Playbook

For this exercise, your objective will be to print the contents of an environment variable to the console using an Ansible Playbook via a [role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html).

### Prerequisites

You should have installed Ansible in your local machine. You can confirm using:
    
    pip show ansible 

### Instructions

1. Create a new Ansible Playbook file named `main.yml` (starting out, it's just a blank text file).
2. Create a new directory named `roles`.
3. In the roles directory, create a new folder called `print`.
4. Inside `print`, create a new folder called `tasks`.
5. Create a task to be executed by the role. Name it `/roles/print/tasks/main.yml` and add the following [code](https://github.com/SudKul/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/roles/print/tasks/main.yml):

```
    ---
    - name: Print env variable
    shell: echo $PATH
    register: print_result

    - name: print message
    debug:
        msg: "{{ print_result.stdout_lines }}"
```

> **Note**: Be careful with the indentation of the YAML code snippet above. It may get distorted while copying-pasting.

6. Your folder structure should look like this:
```
    ├── main.yml                # Playbbook file
    └── roles
    └── print
        └── tasks
            └── main.yml    # Task file
```

7. Navigate back to the folder that contains your Playbook (in case you navigated away).
8. Add the following [code](https://github.com/SudKul/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/main2.yml) to your Playbook file:
```
    ---
    - name: Exercise #1
    hosts: localhost

    roles:
    - print
```

Notice that we reference a role named `print`. We didn't mention a path to the task file. That's because Ansible knows where to look as long as we follow the folder structure convention!
9. Run your playbook using the command `ansible-playbook main.yml`.
10. You should see some results like the following:
```    
TASK [print : print message]     ************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/    sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin"
    ]
}
```

## Build an Ansible Inventory File

https://youtu.be/R8k8970kNQ8

### Script to Create the Initial Inventory File
    
    echo "[all]" > inventory 

### Script to Query EC2 for Instances and Output to File
    
    aws ec2 describe-instances \ 
        --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress' \
        --output text >> inventory 

Here, we called the output file `inventory`. But you could call it anything at all as long as you use the same name when running your Ansible Playbook later on.

Also, in the first script, we use `>` because we are creating a new file. Then, in the second script, we are using `>>` because we want to append the output to the file, not overwrite it (since it has our `[all]` header).

___

## Exercise: Build Ansible Inventory File

We are going to generate an Ansible inventory file using the AWS CLI. So that we can easily reference devices and machines from our Ansible Playbook, we need to list those devices in an [inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.7/user_guide/intro_inventory.html). Instead of creating it manually, we're going to use AWS to list the EC2 instance hostnames and then we will pipe that to an inventory file automatically.

### Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI should be [installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and configured. Verify it using:
    
    aws --version # Run any test command aws iam list-users 

### Instructions

1. Create an EC2 instance in your AWS account using the Ubuntu AMI and micro/free tier VM type. Add a memorable tag like `Project:udacity` to the instance. Please remember the tag name you're adding.
2. Create an inventory file called `inventory` (or _inventory.txt_) with and add `[all]` at the beginning, using these commands:
    
    # Run this in your exercise directory touch inventory echo [all] > inventory 

3. Run the following CLI command to list the EC2 instance and save the IP address to the inventory file:
    
    aws ec2 describe-instances \
        --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress' \
        --filters "Name=tag:Project,Values=udacity" \
        --output text >> inventory 

4. This will append the udacity-tagged instance **public IP** addresses to our inventory file and should look something like this:
    
    [all] 169.254.123.12 # The public IP will be different in your case 

5. **Important** - The next exercise is based on the results of the current exercise. Therefore, you can continue using the _inventory_ file and the EC2 instance in the next exercises. Otherwise, you must terminate the EC2 instance created for this exercise to clean up.

### For Some Extra Challenge

Try wrapping this script in a Circle CI job and save the inventory file to the cache or workspace. You'll have to do this later in your project, but it might help to try it now to get a head start!

## Remote Control Using Ansible

https://youtu.be/ejitRE3Ff2k

## Building an Ansible Playbook from a Tutorial

Ansible is like a remote control robot that teleports in (via SSH of course) to our remote machine and performs some shell commands on our behalf. Seriously, it's just THAT simple. So, in theory, you could take any tutorial on the web and turn it into an Ansible Playbook. That's what we're doing right here!

If you'd like to try this for yourself, here's the tutorial I followed in the video: [Installing Apache](https://riptutorial.com/apache/example/5607/-ubuntu--simple-hello-world-example)

![Apache installed on EC2 host](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/September/612f99e4_ex3-output/ex3-output.png)

## Exercise: Remote Control Using Ansible

Build a playbook that automates configuration of an EC2 instance by adapting [manual instructions](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/nodejs-ubuntu-getting-started/) to Ansible Playbook tasks.

### Prerequisites

1. **Key pair** - You should have an [AWS EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) already created in your AWS Console, and downloaded to your local mahcine. We are assuming the key pair name is **udacity.pem**.
2. **EC2 instance** - An AWS EC2 **Ubuntu** instance mapped with the _udacity.pem_ key-pair should be running in your AWS account. Don't forget to associate a tag, such as `Project:udacity` to the instance.
3. **Inventory** file - The inventory file containing the public IP address of your AWS EC2 Ubuntu VM must be present in your exercise directory. Refer to the **Exercise: Inventory File**, if the inventory file is not available. The contents should be like:
    
    [all] 169.254.123.12 # The public IP will be different in your case 

Note that if you are using Udacity provided AWS account, then the public IP of the EC2 instance will change at the beginning of each new session.

### Instructions

1. Go to the Security group of your EC2 instance, and add an inbound rule to allow incoming TCP communication on port `3000` from all public IPs (`0.0.0.0/0`).
2. Create a new Playbook file named `main-remote.yml` with the following [code](https://github.com/SudKul/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/main4.yml):
    
```
    ---
 # Exercise for setting up a web server in an EC
 - name: Exercise for setting up a web server in an EC 
   # hosts: ubuntu
   # Use the public IP if the VM is already created
   hosts: all
   user: ubuntu
   become: true
   become_method: sudo
   become_user: root
   roles:
    - setup
```
Notice the reference to `all` here. That refers to the `[all]` we added to the top of the inventory file in the previous exercise.
3. Create a role for `setup`. Remember how to do that? Your folder structure should be named after the role and should contain a `tasks` folder and a `files` folder. Just in case you need a reminder, your folder structure should look like this:
    
```
.
├── main-remote.yml     # Playbook file. 
└── roles
 └── setup
     ├── files
     │   └── index.js
     └── tasks
         └── main.yml
```

4. Create a simple web server file in NodeJS - `roles/setup/files/index.js` containing the following content.
    
```
var http = require("http");
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
res.writeHead(200);
res.end("Hello world!");
});
server.listen(3000);
```

5. Add a new task file - `roles/setup/tasks/main.yml`. This task file should contain instructions to:
  * update apt packages
  * upgrade packages
  * install dependencies, such as NodeJS and NPM
  * install pm2
  * create a `~/web` directory
  * copy index test page from `files/index.js` to `~/web/index.js`
  * Start the weeb server using the command `pm2 start ~/web/index.js -f`

Refer to the manual steps from this [tutorial](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/nodejs-ubuntu-getting-started/). As a hint, the file should start by updating and upgrading the packages in the Ubuntu server like this:
    
```
---
- name: "update apt packages."
  become: yes
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: "upgrade packages"
  become: tyes
  apt:
    upgrade: yes
```

In case you strongly need help, you can refer to this [code](https://github.com/SudKul/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/roles/setup/tasks/main.yml) in the Github solution repository.
6. Now let's run the Playbook using your inventory file and `udacity.pem` file:
    
    # Assuming the udacity.pem and inventory files are present in the current directory ansible-playbook main-remote.yml -i inventory --private-key udacity.pem 

7. **Troubleshoot** - If you face **fatal: UNREACHABLE!** like errors, check two things:
  * **Username** - The user mentioned in the Playbook file. For Ubuntu instances, the user will be `ubuntu`. Whereas, for Amazon Linux 2 instance, the user will be `ec2-user`. We are using Ubuntu instances. See a similar discussion [here](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/371618).
  * **IP address** - Check the public IP address of your EC2 instance in the AWS web console, and in the inventory file. If you are using Udacity provided federated AWS account, then the public IP of the EC2 instance will change at the beginning of each new session.
  * If you still facing accessability issue during SSH, then create a _ansible.cfg_ file in the top level directory, with the following content:

```
    [defaults]
    host_key_checking = false 
```
8. After running all the plays, Ansible should give you a successful message.
9. You should be able to navigate to the hostname:port (e.g. `3000`) of the instance and view your Hello World message.
10. **Important** - The next exercise is based on the results of the current exercise. Therefore, you can continue using the _inventory_ file, and the EC2 instance in the next exercises. Otherwise, you must terminate the EC2 instance created for this exercise to clean up.
