### Setting Up Prometheus

1. Launch a new instance in EC2 with port `9090` open to the public.
2. Log into the instance via SSH.
3. Download and extract the Prometheus server files.
4. Start Prometheus.
5. Open the instance's hostname or IP address in your browser with port `9090`.
6. Profit!

### Editing Your `prometheus.yml` File

If you're still feeling uncertain when working with this file, don't worry! We'll be seeing it a lot more during this lesson.

## Exercise: Set Up Prometheus

Set up a Prometheus server in EC2\.

### Instructions:

1. Create a new EC2 instance. Micro/free tier works great!
2. If you don't have a key pair created already in your AWS Console, you should do that now. Folllow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) to create the key pair and save a copy to your computer in a file named `keypair.pem`.
3. SSH into the instance using the console using the key pair.
4. Install the application "Prometheus" using the instructions in [this tutorial](https://codewizardly.com/prometheus-on-aws-ec2-part1/).
5. Open up port `9090` on the EC2 instance's security groups.
6. Browse to the Prometheus application using the EC2 instance's hostname and port `9090` to verify it's working.

# Exporters

### Exporters Abound

Data is pulled from various data sources using lightweight agents called an **Exporters** that are installed on or attached to the data sources themselves. Once it knows about an exporter, Prometheus "scrapes" data from those exporters every few seconds. No matter how many exporters you have providing data, Prometheus can scrape them all and happily collect your monitoring data in near real-time.

**Prometheus Works with Lots of Different Data Sources!**

### Node Exporters

### Available Exporters
| Exporters           | Purpose                                                                                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node exporter       | Provides basic operating system metrics like CPU, Disk and Memory Usage.                         |
| Nginx VTS Exporter  | Provides metrics on connections, server zones, and upstream requests.                            |
| Blackbox exporter   | The Blackbox exporter allows black-box probing of endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, and ICMP |
| Github Exporter     | Provides metrics on repository commits, pull requests, and issues.                               |
| MongoDB Exporter    | The MongoDB exporter periodically scrapes MongoDB server stats.                                  |
| Jira Exporter       | Provides metrics on Jira issues and projects.                                                    |
| Swagger Stats       | API performance stats available to Prometheus                                                    |
| AWS Health Exporter | Provides health metrics on all AWS services and regions.                                         |
... and [many more](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/master/content/docs/instrumenting/exporters.md).

Even with all these existing exporters, you might need something that doesn't exist yet. The documentation is very helpful and mature, but there's a steep learning curve. One way you can flatten that curve a bit is to use an existing exporter and modifying it.

### Key Terms:

* **Exporter**
* **Pull System**

## Exercise: Configuring Node Exporter

Configure a simple "exporter" in an EC2 instance so that its data and metrics are available to Prometheus. Also, configure Prometheus to auto-detect EC2 instances with built-in Service Discovery so that the new instance don't need to be added manually.

### Instructions:

1. Create a new EC2 instance for testing.
2. SSH into and configure the EC2 instance with `node_exporter` using the instructions in [this tutorial](https://codewizardly.com/prometheus-on-aws-ec2-part2/).
3. Connect again via SSH to your Prometheus server in EC2\.
4. Configure Prometheus to discover EC2 instances automatically following [this tutorial](https://codewizardly.com/prometheus-on-aws-ec2-part3/).
5. View the test EC2 instance in Prometheus.


# Dynamic discovery
```
- job_name: 'node'
  ec2_sd_configs:
    - region: eu-west-2
      access_key: xxx
      secret_key: xxx
      port: 9100
```
