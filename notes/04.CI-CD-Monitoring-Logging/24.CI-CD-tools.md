# CI/CD Tools

## Tools

Plenty of tools exist that can handle the entire CI and CD pipeline. Some tools can be installed on your own hardware, while others are cloud-based services.

### Common Features

Whether your tool is on-prem or a SaaS product, it will likely have at least the basic features of any CI/CD system. Getting to know these common features will help you to be a little more "tool agnostic".

| Feature                      | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scoped Environment Variables | These are Environment variables that are built-in or defined at various scope levels including account, project, pipeline and job.                                                                      |
| Steps                        | A step is an instruction that should be run during a job in order to accomplish a single goal.                                                                                                          |
| Jobs                         | A job is made up of a group of steps that should run in a specific order.                                                                                                                               |
| Job Images                   | Jobs can take advantage of various pre-existing Docker images that provide an environment in which to run steps.                                                                                        |
| Agents                       | An agent is a machine, either physical or virtual, that responds to the CI/CD system to run jobs on-demand.                                                                                             |
| Pipelines                    | A pipeline is a set of instructions to run a group of jobs in parallel or sequentially and according to a pre-determined dependency tree.                                                               |
| File Sharing                 | File sharing in the CI/CD context is the ability to share files between jobs, even though the jobs might be run on completely different images or agents.                                               |
| Code-Based Configuration     | Code-based configuration enables engineers to build configuration files that define and control CI/CD pipelines. These files can be saved to disk, shared with others, and versioned in source control. |
| Failure Branching            | Failure branching allows engineers to write instructions that should be run only in the event of a job failure.                                                                                         |

### Installable/On-Prem
Your team may prefer an on-prem CI/CD server running closer to the development team. There are a lot of great options with varying pricing models. One major benefit to an on-prem CI/CD server is a high degree of control. On the other hand, an on-prem CI/CD server requires time from someone in the team to maintain. The list below has a few options, but certainly not all!

### Cloud-Based
Some teams prefer to use cloud-based services since they require mush less time to maintain and configure. The list below is far from exhaustive. There are many many options out there. These are just a few of our favorites.

### In This Course

Throughout this course, we will be using Circle CI because of the following reasons:

* Circle CI's features are fairly universal
* Since it's a cloud-based tool, Circle CI will not require much configuration
* Circle CI has a free tier that is fairly generous
