### Data Visualization Tools

It's not really practical to read monitoring data in its raw form. If we're doing it right, there will be WAY too much of it to make sense of, even for a super-human like you. Monitoring data is best enjoyed through a data visualization tool. In all seriousness, once you pipe your data through a data visualizer, you'll start to make sense of the data in ways that raw data is simply incapable of doing.

| Tool Name          | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Grafana            | Recommended for Prometheus                   |
| Kibana             | Recommended for Elastic Stack                |
| DataDog            | Built in to DataDog cloud-based service      |
| Expression Browser | Built in to Prometheus, okay for experiments |

### Further Research:

* Read more about Prometheus's query language called [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).

## Exercise: Graph Memory Usage

Add a graph for memory usage to your Prometheus server.

### Instructions:

1. Browse to your Prometheus dashboard on port 9`090`.
2. Go to the "Graph tab".
3. Take a look at all the options in the dropdown labeled "insert metric at cursor".
4. Create a few graphs to see what kind of information you can get. You can find some examples [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/examples/).
5. Create a graph that shows available memory for your EC2 instances with `node_exporter` running.

### Test Queries:
```
node_memory_MemFree_bytes
node_memory_MemFree_bytes / 1024000
prometheus_http_requests_total{job="prometheus", handler="/api/v1/query"}[5m]
```
