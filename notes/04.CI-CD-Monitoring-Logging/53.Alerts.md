# Sending Alert Messages

### Alerting Channels

How do you want to receive alerts?

* Email
* Chat Tool
* Desktop Notifications
* Phone Calls

### Helpful Alerting

Alerts should, whenever possible, point the way to the source of the problem so that it can be fixed quickly.

* Alerts should always include a brief description of the problem _(the easier to understand, the better)_.
* For code-related issues like run-time exceptions, a stack trace and source code line number is always appreciated.
* When a URL is available to direct the troubleshooting engineer to the problem, it should be included in the alert.

Even though you could get really carried away with all the goodies you could cram into your alerts, we encourage you to keep them simple and to the point. Team member contact information is probably crossing the line. Trying to mix in cross-referenced incident data is probably out-of-scope for an alerting system. Both examples are valid and useful, but just not in the alerting context.

### Adding Alertmanager

### Alerting in Prometheus

Alerts are not available in the core installation of Prometheus. We have to install a utility called [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) alongside Prometheus and configure them to talk to one another. Then, we can create alerting rules that decide when to send out alerts and to whom.

Alerting rules actually use the same [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) expressions that saw in the Expression Browser.

## Exercise: Sending Alert Messages

Configure AlertManager to notify of a critical error.

### Instructions:

1. Open port `9093` to traffic in the security groups of your EC2 instance.
2. SSH into your Prometheus server (EC2 instance from the previous exercise)
3. Follow the instructions in [this tutorial](https://codewizardly.com/prometheus-on-aws-ec2-part4/) to set up Alertmanager and alerting rules for Prometheus.
4. Set up a "receiver" for Slack, Pager Duty, or email using Gmail (or your own SMTP server).
5. Restart the server and you should see an alert!
