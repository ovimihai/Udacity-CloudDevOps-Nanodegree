**Stop Number Two!**

### In this Lesson, We Will...

* Learned about CI and How It Fits in the Bigger Picture
* Discussed Some Behaviors of CI Veterans
* Went Over Some of the Common Building Blocks of Most CI Tools, Like:
  * Environment Variables
  * Triggers
  * Pipelines
  * Jobs
  * File Sharing Between Jobs
  * Re-Usable Job Code
  * Job Failures
* Designed a Complete CI Pipeline

I hope to give you enough information and practice in the art of Continuous Integration that you will be able to adopt and implement it in any of your future projects. Let's get started!

## Big Picture

#### What is CI?

**Continuous Integration** is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project _([definition from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration))_.

#### CI Opens Doors

* Singular, Unified, Consistent Build Process
* Automatically Packaged and Downloadable "Binaries"
* Faster Recovery from botched Integration (If You Break It, You Fix It!)
* Unit Test Suite Gets Some Respect
* Greater Transparency and Communication
* More Time Adding Value (aka Developing Software)

**Many Contributors, One Goal**

### Differentiating between CI and CD

_**Continuous integration** is all about the source code._

New changes to the code need to be validated, verified, exercised, worked over, massaged and squeezed to see if there are leaks. We do this by compiling, transpiling, linting, running unit tests, performing static analysis, checking dependencies for security vulnerabilities and other things.

_**Continuous deployment** is all about built code and deployment._

Once the source code has been built in CI, we're ready to ship it to servers and devices either in the same network or elsewhere. Depending on your team's delivery process and deployment strategy, you might deploy to a staging or pre-production server for final testing or you might deploy to production right away. Before doing so, CD can run scripts to prepare the infrastructure, run smoke tests, and handle rollbacks and reverts if something doesn't go as planned.

## Intuition

### Characteristics of Healthy CI Pipelines

We want to create healthy, consistent pipelines in order to create a better build process!

* Highest Priority When the Build is Broken
* Trusted Members of the Team
* Have the Same Abilities as any Member of the Team
* Enforce Team Quality Rules
* Communicate Useful Information
* Shorten Feedback Loops
* Don't Require Stacks of Documentation
* Automated to the End!
