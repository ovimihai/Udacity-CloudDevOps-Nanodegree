### Removing _Human_ Error

Before we implement CI/CD almost _everything_ requires human intervention. Can you imagine a world without human error?

... Neither can I, but with CI/CD, we can reduce it!

### How do you know you need CI/CD or Continuous Delivery?

_There are several "warning signs" that teams exhibit that suggest they would be good candidates for CI/CD or Continuous Delivery. If you identify with any of these items, you should consider CI/CD an essential piece of your development workflow._

* Investing **more time** in a release cycle than delivering value
* Going through integration hell every time we finish a feature
* **Code gets lost** because of botched merges
* Unit test suite hasn't been green in ages
* Deployments contribute to **schedule slip**
* Friction between ops and development departments
* **Only one engineer** can deploy a system
* _**Deployments are not cause for celebration**_

### No Free Lunch

_No pain, no gain, right? Did you think CI/CD was going to solve all your woes and ask nothing in return? Think again!_

* No more manual deploying to environments
* No more modifying environment settings in GUI's
* No more neglecting the unit tests
* No more leaving broken code in place
* Requires a high level of discipline
* Requires additional skills to maintain and extend automation

### Continuous Integration

_The practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. It's the process of "**Making**". Everything related to the code fits here, and it all culminates in the ultimate goal of CI: a high quality, deployable artifact! Some common CI-related phases might include:_

* Compile
* Unit Test
* Static Analysis
* Dependency vulnerability testing
* Store artifact

### Continuous Deployment

_A software engineering approach in which the value is delivered frequently through automated deployments. Everything related to deploying the artifact fits here. It's the process of "**Moving**" the artifact from the shelf to the spotlight. Some common CD-related phases might include:_

* Creating infrastructure
* Provisioning servers
* Copying files
* Promoting to production
* Smoke Testing (aka Verify)
* Rollbacks

**The Phases of CI/CD Pipeline**

### Key Terms

* **Pipeline**: A set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one.
* **Continuous Integration**: The practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
* **Continuous Delivery**: An engineering practice in which teams produce and release value in short cycles.
* **Continuous Deployment**: A software engineering approach in which the value is delivered frequently through automated deployments.
* **Infrastructure as Code**: The management of infrastructure using code.
* **Provisioning**: The process of setting up IT infrastructure.
* **Artifact**: A product of some process applied to the code repository.
* **DevOps**: A set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.
* **Testing**: A practice that seeks to ensure the quality of the software.

### Why Is Translation Important?

_If the decision-makers in your company can't understand why something is important or adds value, they might not approve it. This usually isn't because they're ignorant or trying to be difficult, this is often because they don't understand how the technical changes translate into benefits for the company. Using language they understand will make everyone's lives better and easier!_

| Technical Language                              | Value            | Translation                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Catch Compile Errors After Merge                | Reduce Cost      | Less developer time on issues from new developer code     |
| Catch Unit Test Failures                        | Avoid Cost       | Less bugs in production and less time in testing          |
| Detect Security Vulnerabilities                 | Avoid Cost       | Prevent embarrassing or costly security holes             |
| Automate Infrastructure Creation                | Avoid Cost       | Less human error, Faster deployments                      |
| Automate Infrastructure Cleanup                 | Reduce Cost      | Less infrastructure costs from unused resources           |
| Faster and More Frequent Production Deployments | Increase Revenue | New value-generating features released more quickly       |
| Deploy to Production Without Manual Checks      | Increase Revenue | Less time to market                                       |
| Automated Smoke Tests                           | Protect Revenue  | Reduced downtime from a deploy-related crash or major bug |
| Automated Rollback Triggered by Job Failure     | Protect Revenue  | Quick undo to return production to working state          |



## Exercise: Benefits of CI/CD

Let's practice translating from technical language to business language.

I'll play the boss in your company. For fun, let's pretend that I am really great at running the business, but technology is not my strong suit. Your team wants to start working with CI/CD, _someone_ has to come to my office to convince me to set aside some days for implementation, and you drew "the short straw."

Pick two of the most compelling benefits of CI/CD and write a paragraph for each, explaining to me why it should be implemented in your team. Let's see if you can convince me! **Don't forget to use some of the "translations" you learned about earlier!**

Here are a few examples to choose from:

1. Smaller code changes
2. Error Isolation
3. Reduced deploy errors
4. More reliable tests
5. Faster release rate
6. Increase accountability and transparency
7. Smaller backlog
8. Faster error resolution time
9. Customer satisfaction
10. Team satisfaction
11. Easy maintenance and updates


## Solution: Benefits of CI/CD

https://youtu.be/ER63We0nxDs

Isn't CI/CD great? Now, not only do you understand CI/CD and it's benefits, but you also know how to "sell" it to decision-makers! Way to go!

![A graphic showing the Technical Team and Business Team as one unified team.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f0616c8_screen-shot-2020-07-01-at-1.35.58-pm/screen-shot-2020-07-01-at-1.35.58-pm.png)

**One Team with One Language**

It's great, as a technical member of the team, for you to understand the benefits of CI/CD. This way, when you're banging your head against the wall because of some confusing mess you've gotten yourself into, you will remember the benefits and they will motivate you to keep going! But, it's quite possibly more important that you understand how to translate these benefits to other members of the team so they can understand how CI/CD will benefit their area of responsibility as well!

Remember, whenever you are attempting to convince business people of some technical benefit, you should always translate it to either revenue or cost. **If the benefits truly outweigh the costs of implementation, you'll find that the business will often give you the green light.**
