## Reusable Job Code

### Common Reuse Scenarios:

* Common Defaults
* Rollback
* Compile Code
* Deploy

### Ways to Reuse Code in Circle CI

* Anchors and Aliases
* Commands

### Key Terms

| Key Term | Description                                                                                                    |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Anchor   | Defines a section of yaml to be reused. Uses a & symbol to signal that an anchor is being defined.             |
| Alias    | Refers to a section of yaml previously defined by an anchor. Uses the * to signal that an alias is being used. |
| Command  | A predefined parameterized sequence of steps to be executed in a job.                                          |
| DRY      | Stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself".                                                                            |

## Exercise: Reusable Commands

Create a job that uses a "command" that prints the pipelineId to the console.

### Instructions:

1. Use the repository and Circle CI config file from previous exercises or create a new one.
2. If you'd like, you can remove the jobs we added from previous exercises.
3. Add a [command](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#commands-requires-version-21) section below the version number.
4. Create a command named `print_pipeline_id` with a step that prints the Circle CI Workflow ID from its environment variable named `$CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID` to the console.
5. Use the command in a job.
6. Add the job to a workflow.
7. Run the pipeline and verify the workflow ID is being printed to the console.


Solution:

```yaml
version: 2.1

commands:
  print_pipeline_id:
    steps:
      - run: echo ${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}

jobs:
  my_job:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:13.8.0
    steps:
      - print_pipeline_id

workflows:
  my_workflow:
    jobs:
      - my_job
```
