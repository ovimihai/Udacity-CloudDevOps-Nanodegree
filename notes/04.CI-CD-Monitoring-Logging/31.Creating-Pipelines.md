## Creating Pipelines

### Single Responsibility Principle
> 
> The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module or function.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

When we limit the responsibilities of our jobs, we get some nice side-effects:

* Jobs tend to be smaller and quicker
* We get better and more focused feedback when there's a job failure
* The pipeline is more visually expressive, so non-technical people can better understand the pipeline

### Anatomy of a `config.yml` File

### Remember:

![A graphics that says "Pipelines have workflows that have jobs that have steps."](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/May/5ed263a3_pipeline-structure/pipeline-structure.png)

Circle CI uses a yaml file to handle the configuration of pipelines and jobs.

| Section    | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| version   | Specifies the version of CircleCI's runner you want to use. Most of the time, use the latest.                                                                  |
| jobs      | List of jobs.                                                                                                                                                  |
| commands  | List of reusable commands that can be used as steps in jobs.                                                                                                   |
| orbs      | Makes available some pre-written functionality that you can include in your jobs. Orbs become step types which we will see later when we talk more about jobs. |
| workflows | Puts the jobs in execution order, sets up dependencies.                                                                                                        |

### Workflows
In Circle CI, a pipeline is made up of one or more workflows. Workflows contain jobs.

| Workflow Option | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <workflow_name> | The name of the workflow that appears in the Circle CI web app. You can have multiple workflows for different scenarios, so it's helpful to give them future-proof names. |
| jobs            | A list of jobs, already defined elsewhere in the config file, and some instructions on when to run them.                                                                  |

### Workflow Job Options
A workflow defines the order in which we will run jobs.

| Workflow Job Option | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <job_name>          | The name of the corresponding job.                                                                                                               |
| requires            | Jobs are run in parallel by default, so if your job doesn't require any other jobs, they will all just run at the same time, or in random order. |
| filters             | Excludes jobs based on current branch or tag.                                                                                                    |
