## Build Stages
Think of stages like categories or types of jobs. Stages are used to group jobs and control timing.

| Stage   | Description                                                                                                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build   | Everything that has to do with making code executable in production (e.g. Compile). The goal is to produce an artifact. |
| Test    | All automated tests that verify at the code level.                                                                      |
| Analyze | Any static analysis on the code or checking of dependencies.                                                            |
| Deploy  | Anything to do with creating server instances or copying pre-built application files to an instance.                    |
| Verify  | Any tests that can be run against a running instance of the application, often against a pre-production instance.       |
| Promote | Replacing the current production environment with the new version which was just built and deployed.                    |
| Revert  | Rolling back or undoing changes in case any verification fails after deployment.                                        |

**The Stages of CI/CD Pipeline**

### Jobs and Steps

**Jobs** are what actually do the work of CI/CD. Each job has a name and defines a set of instructions to run and an environment in which to run those instructions. The instructions are called **steps**. Each step has a name and a bit of instructions to carry out a script to execute or a task to complete.

## Exercise: Pipeline Building Blocks

Create a diagram of a complete CI/CD pipeline including passing and failing branches.

### Instructions:

1. Open your favorite diagraming or drawing application. [Draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/) and [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) are both great options. Even PowerPoint or Google Slides would do the trick. If all else fails, a piece of paper and a pencil would be fine.
2. Think through the steps your code needs to take between check-in and deployment. Ask yourself, "What are all the things that need to be done?" Try your best to keep things fairly granular.
3. Use shapes like circles and squares to represent stops along the journey to deployment. Label your shapes with one or two words to describe the jobs that need to be done. This doesn't need to be a formal flow-chart or UML diagram (unless you like that sort of thing).
4. Connect the shapes to represent the sequence of events.
5. Add in some branches in your diagram to represent failures. Think about what should happen in each failure and write that in.
6. Test our your pipeline with a few imaginary scenarios to see how well it holds up.

### Design the Pipeline

## One Solution, Not _The_ Solution

Depending on your project and your pipeline, your diagram might look different from mine! Maybe you're not using Slack to display success or failure messages or maybe you're using a different deployment strategy. Use my below solution as a reference, but it's not the only answer!
