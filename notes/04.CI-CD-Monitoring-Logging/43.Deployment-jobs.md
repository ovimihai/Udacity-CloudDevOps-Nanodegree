## Deployment Jobs

https://youtu.be/DaFOpPFXOdQ

The next few sections of this lesson will cover the pipeline jobs that would normally make up a Blue Green Deployment pipeline. We will create infrastructure, configure infrastructure, deploy our application, verify it is working, revert, and clean up if necessary, and finally promote the new production version if possible! All of this in the context of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Infrastructure Creation Jobs

https://youtu.be/2-_VGUYdy4g

## Let's Create Some Infrastructure

Ideally, when you are running a Blue Green Deployment, you are creating new infrastructure for each CI/CD run. In other words, each time you run a CI/CD build, you will be using an "Infrastructure as Code" tool like CloudFormation to build up the needed AWS instances and resources for a fresh deployment.

### What is Needed in This Job?

1. AWS credentials saved in your project environment variables so they are available to the AWS CLI _([Instructions](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project))_.
2. An image that has AWS CLI pre-installed.
3. A filter to only run this job on the `master` branch.
4. To check out the code.
5. A step that executes CloudFormation with our template.

# Exercise: Infrastructure Creation

Write a job that creates your infrastructure - an EC2 instance and the associated Security group.

## Prerequisites

1. **Key pair** - You should have an [AWS EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) already created in your AWS Console, and downloaded to your local mahcine. We are assuming the key pair name is **udacity.pem**.
2. A public Github repository.
3. An account in the [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/).

## Instructions

### Step 1\. Set up a CircleCI project

* Go to [https://app.circleci.com/](https://app.circleci.com/) and set up a new project associated with your Github repository.

![Set up a new project in CircleCI](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618ce4bc_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-3.05.44-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-3.05.44-pm.png)

Set up a new project in CircleCI

* If you repo does not contain a _./circleci/config.yml_ file, it will prompt you to create one. Choose a "hello-world" starter config file. The CircleCI will attempt the first build process. Don't worry if it fails at this moment.

![Feel free to choose a ""hello-world" starter config.yml template or ensure to have a (blank) `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repo. ](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618ce4e6_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-3.06.36-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-3.06.36-pm.png)

Feel free to choose a ""hello-world" starter config.yml template or ensure to have a (blank) `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repo.

### Step 2\. Set up Environment variables

* To use the AWS CLI in your jobs you'll need to the following environment variables to the in Circle CI \> Project Settings \> environment variables. The value of these variables can be fetched from the AWS IAM user.
* If not already, create an AWS IAM user with programmatic access, and it will generate these credentials.
    
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_DEFAULT_REGION AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 

  * **Note** - While saving the environment variables in the Circle CI project settings, use capital case as discussed in this [thread](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/551906) and also mentioned [here](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-cli) (see the DEFAULT column for the correct names).
  * Another useful reference: [Setting an environment variable in a project](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project). Do read about the various types of environment variables and their relative priorities.

![Adding environment variables to the CircleCI project](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618cf760_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-4.26.38-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-4.26.38-pm.png)

Add environment variables to the CircleCI project

### Step 3\. Create the CloudFormation template

* Create a simple template - _template.yml_ that will create an EC2 instance and the associated security group. This should be pushed into your git repo.
    
```
# Exercise - Rollback
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: ND9991 C3 L4 
Resources:
  EC2Instance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Properties:
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref InstanceSecurityGroup
      # Change this, as applicable to you      
      KeyName: udacity
      # Change this, as applicable to you
      # You may need to find out what instance types are available in your region - use https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/
      ImageId: 'ami-09e67e426f25ce0d7' 
      InstanceType: t3.micro
  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup'
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable SSH access via port 22
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: '22'
          ToPort: '22'
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 
```

Important points:
  * Be mindful of copy-pasting the code above. It may break the YAML indentation. The code is also available [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/main/template.yml).
  * Change the `KeyName` and `ImageId`, as applicable to you.
  * We have used the `udacity` as the `KeyName`. That refers to the key pair we created before.
  * Fetch and use the correct AMI ID similar to as shown in the snapshot below.

![Choose the AMI ID as shown above](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/September/612f8c23_screenshot-2021-08-24-at-4.38.11-pm/screenshot-2021-08-24-at-4.38.11-pm.png)

Choose the AMI ID as shown above

### Step 4\. Create the CircleCI Config file

* The _./circleci/config.yml_ file will have the following sections:
    
```
version: 2.1
# Use a package of configuration called an orb.
orbs:
  # Choose either one of the orbs below
  # welcome: circleci/welcome-orb@0.4.1
  # aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@2.0.3
# Define the jobs we want to run for this project
jobs:
  myjob1:  # Choose any name, such as `build`
      # The primary container, where your job's commands will run
      docker:
        - image: 
      steps:
        - checkout # check out the code in the project directory
        - run: echo "hello world" # run the `echo` command
# Sequential workflow
workflows:
  # Name the workflow
  myWorkflow:
    jobs:
      - myjob1
      - myjob2
``` 

Create a job in your Circle CI config file named `create_infrastructure`.
    
```
  create_infrastructure: 
      docker:
        - image: amazon/aws-cli
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run:
            name: Create Cloudformation Stack
            command: |
              aws cloudformation deploy \
                --template-file template.yml \
                --stack-name myStack-${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:0:5} \
                --region us-east-1
```

Be mindful of copying-pasting the YAML code above. The job code above:
  * uses `amazon/aws-cli` docker image that has AWS CLI installed already.
  * executes the CloudFormation template to create the infrastructure.

* Add the `create_infrastructure` job to the workflows section, and comment out the unrelated jobs.
> 
> **Tip**: You should keep your build-workflow minimal. The CircleCI build time depends on how many jobs a user wants to run on their containers.

* If you strongly need help, refer to the particular job in this [file](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c3-hello-world-exercise-solution/blob/936fceab6ddb7a3333d0b75ecd79e28df980ee6a/.circleci/config.yml#L68) on Github.
    
```
workflows:
  my_workflow:
      jobs:
        - create_infrastructure
```

* Push your local change to the remote Github repo. Your commits will automatically trigger a CircleCI build.

![Successful `create_infrastructure` job](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618d0ede_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-6.08.13-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-6.08.13-pm.png)

Successful `create_infrastructure` job

* Once the job has run successfully, check for your new stack in [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) in the AWS Console to see if it was created.

![The Cloudformation stack created due to `aws cloudformation deploy` command present in the CircleCI job](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618d0fa7_screenshot-2021-11-11-at-6.11.43-pm/screenshot-2021-11-11-at-6.11.43-pm.png)

The Cloudformation stack created due to `aws cloudformation deploy` command present in the CircleCI job

* If you are continuing to the next exeercise, then the current stack resources (EC2 instance) will be used there. Otherwise, remove the stack manually from Cloudformation in the AWS Console to clean up.

## Configuration and Deployment Jobs

### What is Needed In This Job?

1. An image that gets us ready to run Ansible.
2. A filter to only run this job on `master` branch.
3. Our ssh keys/key pair for our EC2 instance.
4. Install the Ansible CLI in the job.
5. An inventory file with the hostname or IP address of our EC2 instance in it.
6. An Ansible playbook that configures the instance and copies files.
7. A step that executes Ansible.
8. A dependency in our workflow to make sure the infrastructure creation job finishes before this job runs.

In case you haven't added your SSH keys to Circle CI yet, check out [these instructions](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/add-ssh-key) in the doc to do that now.

## Smoke Testing Jobs

### Smoke Tests Build Confidence

If you hope to get any closer to true Continuous Delivery, you need to focus on building confidence in your stakeholders. In a manual deployment scenario, humans will often "kick the tires" on a new deployment and, if everything is working as expected, give their stamp of approval to go ahead and complete the deployment. Many times, those human smoke tests can be replaced by automated smoke tests and still provide the same level of confidence that comes from a manual test.

![An image of a pipeline with Verify highlighted*](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/June/5ef0d0be_005-e/005-e.png)

**Now, We've Deployed; Let's Verify It Works!**

### Creating a Smoke Test

### What Do We Need to Pull this Job Off?

1. An entry in the workflow that requires the previous job.
2. A very lightweight image like `alpine:latest`.
3. For my test, I'm going to simply use `curl`, so I need to install it in the job. You can do this with a normal testing tool if you want, but curl works for simple tests.
4. A simple script to verify some condition is true.
5. Exit with non-zero if the test fails.

You can use a simple command like this to see if a website is responding to requests:

```
curl -s --head "https://google.com"
```
You can put that curl command in bash conditional structure to do or return something:


```
if curl -s --head "https://google.com" 
then
  echo "It worked!"
else
  echo "It failed"
fi
```
