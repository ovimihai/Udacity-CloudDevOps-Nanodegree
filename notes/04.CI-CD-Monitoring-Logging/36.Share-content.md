## Sharing Information

### Job Isolation

When it's each job's turn to execute, a fresh instance is booted up using the docker image that is defined in the job. This means, by default, that files and memory that are used during the job are gone after the job completes. In this way, each job is isolated from the other jobs and their parent workflows.

### Ways to Share Information

#### Cache

When forming the key name, you can use a few template variables such as:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {{ .Branch }}                   | The git branch currently being built.                                                                        |
| {{ .BuildNum }}                 | The CircleCI build number for this build.                                                                    |
| {{ .Environment.variableName }} | Adds in the value of an environment variable from any scope.                                                 |
| {{ checksum "filename" }}       | Generates a base64 checksum for the file.                                                                    |
| {{ epoch }}                     | The current time in seconds since the unix epoch. Great to make a unique string to avoid re-using key names. |


In one job:
    
    ...
      - save_cache:
          key: v1-my-project-{{ checksum "project.clj" }}
          paths:
            - ~/.m2
    ...
In another job:
    
    ...
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - v1-my-project-{{ checksum "project.clj" }}
            - v1-my-project-
    ...

#### Workspace

Like a cache, but with [some differences](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#persist_to_workspace).

In one job:
    
    ...
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: /tmp/workspace
          paths:
            - target/application.jar
            - build/*
    ...

In another job:
    
    ...
      - attach_workspace:
          at: /tmp/workspace
    ...

#### 3rd Party Secret Keepers

| Option   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Website         |

| Vault    | Vault is a tool created by Hashicorp. It is a web service and a command line tool that work together to give you the ability to save bits of information securely and then retrieve it later. Since the service is not dependent on the job or pipeline, your jobs can reliably save and retrieve information at will. | vaultproject.io |
| MemStash | A simple web service that takes your key-value pairs and stores securely them for a short period of time. It's a great, low-ceremony way to store quick values and get them back out, no matter which job you're running. Just use curl to save and retrieve your information. MemStash is free to use.                | memstash.io     |

**Caches, Workspaces, and Secret Keepers Can Share Information Between Jobs**

Create and share files between jobs in a workflow.

### Instructions:

1. Use the repository and Circle CI config file from previous exercises or create a new one.
2. If you're reusing your repository, you can remove the `hello world` jobs we added from previous exercises.
3. Add a job named `save_hello_world_output`. It should look very close to the `print_hello` job from the previous exercise with one small exception. We want to output "hello world" to a file called `output.txt`. _If you're not sure how to do this, the bash statement would be something like `echo "text to output here" > output.txt`._
4. Add a persist\_to\_workspace block ([documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#persist_to_workspace)) to that job and reference `output.txt` so that it gets saved to the "workspace" (making it available to other jobs).
5. Add another job named `print_output_file`.
6. In this job, add a attach\_workspace block ([documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#attach_workspace)) (much like attaching a hard drive).
7. In this job, also run a bash command that prints the contents of `output.txt`. _For example: `cat output.txt`._

### Sharing Files

Teacher solution https://youtu.be/Kiv34-jtA4c

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  save_hello_world_output:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:13.8.0
    steps:
      - run: echo "hello world" > ~/output.txt
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: ~/
          paths:
            - output.txt

  print_output_file:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:13.8.0
    steps:
      - attach_workspace:
          at: ~/
      - run: cat ~/output.txt

workflows:
  my_workflow:
    jobs:
      - save_hello_world_output
      - print_output_file:
          requires:
            - save_hello_world_output
```
