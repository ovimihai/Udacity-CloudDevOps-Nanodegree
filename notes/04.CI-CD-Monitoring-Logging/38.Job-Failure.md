## Job Failures

### Non-Zero Exit Codes

If anything in your job throws a non-zero exit code, it will cause the job to fail and stop. But, if you want to respond with more than just a big red "X" on your build, you can use Circle CI's `when: on_fail` directive! Some things you could do in response might include:

* Run a cleanup command/job
* Send a special message
* Alert another service
* Make a red fire engine light go off in your office _(not even kidding... seen it happen)_

**A Failure Might Trigger a Rollback or An Alert!**

Example from [Circle CI docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#example):

```yaml
steps:
  - run:
      name: Testing application
      command: make test
      shell: /bin/bash
      working_directory: ~/my-app
      no_output_timeout: 30m
      environment:
        FOO: bar

  - run: echo 127.0.0.1 devhost | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

  - run: |
      sudo -u root createuser -h localhost --superuser ubuntu &&
      sudo createdb -h localhost test_db

  - run:
      name: Upload Failed Tests
      command: curl --data fail_tests.log http://example.com/error_logs
      when: on_fail
```

## Exercise: Job Failures

Create a job that has an intentional failure in it with a step that runs on fail that prints "Hello Error!" to the console.

### Instructions:

1. Use the repository and Circle CI config file from previous exercises or create a new one.
2. If you'd like, you can remove the jobs we added from previous exercises.
3. Add a job using our favorite lightweight image, `circleci/node:13.8.0`.
4. Add a step that fails (on purpose). To do this, all you need is to exit with a non-zero code. That's easy with bash: `return 1`.
5. Define a second step that should only run if a previous step has failed. To do this, use the filter `when: on_fail`.
6. Define a workflow that uses the job.
7. Watch as your job fails, but runs your error handling step.

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  my_job:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:13.8.0
    steps:
      - run: exit 1
      - run:
          name: on error
          command: echo "Hello Error!"
          when: on_fail

workflows:
  my_workflow:
    jobs:
      - my_job
```
