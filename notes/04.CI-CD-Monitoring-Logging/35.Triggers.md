Builds in continuous integration can't start on their own. They need something to trigger them to start running pipelines. Here are a few common ways to trigger a CI pipeline:


| Trigger                | Description                                                                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Git Branch Commit      | Commit or merge to a branch-like master and push changes to the branch in central repository to start a new build. |
| New Pull/Merge Request | Make changes in a branch or fork and create a pull/merge request to trigger a build.                               |
| API                    | Make a POST or GET request to an API endpoint to kick off a new build.                                             |
| Schedule               | Run a pipeline at a certain time each day or week based on a schedule.                                             |
| Other Pipelines        | Another pipeline might finish a job and then trigger another pipeline.                                             |
| Chat Message           | Using a chat tool, post a message containing special text in order to trigger a build.                             |
| Command-Line Tool      | Use a command-line tool to configure and start a new build.                                                        |

Of all the triggers listed, the first two are the most common since the most logical time to run a new build is when new changes have been introduced.

## Exercise: Trigger an existing workflow

Run a pre-existing workflow.

### Instructions:

1. Fork [this demo repository](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-javascript-express) to your Github account. This will make the repository available to you in Circle CI.
2. Log in to your Circle CI account, make sure you're in the "Projects" page, and find the repository you just forked. If you have more than one repository, you can use the search bar.
3. Click "Set Up Project" next to the repository name.
4. Circle CI will now request an initial setup for the project. Click the "Start Building" button and choose "Add Manually". Then, click "Start Building".
5. Verify the pipeline is running.
6. Go to the repository in Github, select the branch Circle CI created, and modify any file (ex: `readme.md`). Commit the change.
7. Back in Circle CI, verify that the commit triggered another build.
