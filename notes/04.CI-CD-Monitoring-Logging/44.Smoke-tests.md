### Smoke Tests Build Confidence

If you hope to get any closer to true Continuous Delivery, you need to focus on building confidence in your stakeholders. In a manual deployment scenario, humans will often "kick the tires" on a new deployment and, if everything is working as expected, give their stamp of approval to go ahead and complete the deployment. Many times, those human smoke tests can be replaced by automated smoke tests and still provide the same level of confidence that comes from a manual test.

### Creating a Smoke Test

### What Do We Need to Pull this Job Off?

1. An entry in the workflow that requires the previous job.
2. A very lightweight image like `alpine:latest`.
3. For my test, I'm going to simply use `curl`, so I need to install it in the job. You can do this with a normal testing tool if you want, but curl works for simple tests.
4. A simple script to verify some condition is true.
5. Exit with non-zero if the test fails.

You can use a simple command like this to see if a website is responding to requests:
    
    curl -s --head "https://google.com" 

You can put that curl command in bash conditional structure to do or return something:

```
if curl -s --head "https://google.com" 
then
  echo "It worked!"
else
  echo "It failed"
fi
```

## Exercise: Smoke Testing Jobs

Write a job that performs a smoke test.

### Prerequisites

The current exercise is in continuation to the previous Exercise: Config and Deployment.

### Instructions

1. Create a job named `smoke_test` to do a simple check on a website ("[https://blog.udacity.com/"](https://blog.udacity.com/%22)) to see if it exists or not. You can do this easily with `curl`.
2. If the curl command exits with a non-zero, it means the site had an error. Catch the error and make sure the pipeline fails. Your code will look like:
    
```
# Exercise: Smoke Testing
smoke_test:
 docker:
   - image: alpine:latest
 steps:
   - run: apk add --update curl
   - run:
       name: smoke test
       command: |
         URL="https://blog.udacity.com/"
         # Test if website exists
         if curl -s --head ${URL} 
         then
           return 0
         else
           return 1
         fi
```

3. Define a workflow that uses the current job. Comment out the other/unnecessary jobs from the workflow.

1. Push your edits.

1. Ensure to have the Job build successfully in the CircleCI environment.
