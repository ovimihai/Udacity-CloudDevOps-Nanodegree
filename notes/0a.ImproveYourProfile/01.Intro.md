Ensure you're connecting with others across your field using LinkedIn - they'll help you find your next job and grow professionally.

# No Resubmission Required

Unlike other Nanodegree projects, you submit to a Career Service once to get feedback and do not need to meet specifications to continue on in your program. We highly encourage you to take advantage of this guidance; most Alumni who report jobs and other opportunities (such as collaboration) attribute their success to networking.

# Let's Get Started

Submit your LinkedIn profile and receive in-depth and honest feedback from a Career Reviewer. They'll ensure you're presenting your best self to your network.[](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1910/submit-link)
