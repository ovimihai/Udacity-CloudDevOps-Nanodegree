## Find More Connections

In order to use your LinkedIn profile effectively, it's important to have as many connections as possible. In general, 500+ connections are needed to fully optimize your profile.

This may seem like a lot, but once you get rolling, you'll get to that number fast. After you actively start engaging on LinkedIn, by joining groups and going to networking events, your number of connections will climb. You are more likely to show up in search results on LinkedIn if you have more connections, which means you'll be more visible to recruiters.

Here are some examples of the types of connections you could add:

* current and former colleagues
* people you attended school with (high school, university, graduate school, Udacity)
* your favorite teachers and professors
* people you meet at professional events, like conferences and meetups
* volunteering companions
* friends and relatives
* roommates and neighbors
