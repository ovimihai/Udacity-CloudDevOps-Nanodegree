# How to Stand Out

**Imagine:** You're a hiring manager and need to pick 5 people to interview for a role. You get 50 applications, and everyone seems pretty qualified. How do you compare job candidates? You'll probably pick the candidates that stand out the most to you - likely the people who communicate their motivation and dedication for the job.

## Personal Stories

A job candidate's personal story is always unique to them. Employers aren't just looking for someone with the skills, but for someone who can help drive the company's mission forward. That's why they need to know your work ethic and what drives you.

Personal stories are memorable. Connect with your potential boss or colleague by telling your personal story. You want employers to know how you solve problems, overcome challenges, and achieve results. You want employers to know what excites you, what motivates you, what drives you forward.

**All of this can be achieved through effective storytelling and building a personal brand.**
