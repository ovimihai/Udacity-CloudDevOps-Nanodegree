# Spend some time getting these essentials right.

## Name

Here you will need to use your real name, not a pseudonym. No `Codergirl42`, no `HireMe McJoberson`, just your real first and last name.
> 
> _Pro Tip:_ You can add former names to your Profile. See [instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1288) from LinkedIn.

## Profile Picture

#### Do

* Upload a picture cropped to your head and shoulders.
* Aim for a high resolution photo.

#### Don't

* No inappropriate or unprofessional items or environments.
* Don't include other people - this is _your_ profile after all!
* No selfies. Someone is willing to take a photo for you, we promise!

#### Quiz: Professional Profile Picture

## Headline

Your headline should be one of the following options:

* **Your Current Job Title**. This is the simplest but most effective way to optimize SEO; LinkedIn even defaults to suggesting you do this.
* **Your Education**. If you do not yet have a job in your new industry, add your education such as "Data Analyst Nanodegree Graduate." You still include the key term "data analyst".
* **Your Target Job**. Remember when Chris said his job search improved when he finally called himself a software engineer? If you're a Nanodegree graduate with a portfolio of real-world projects to share, feel confident and list your target job title.

## Summary

You should already have your summary, crafted from your elevator pitch, from the exercise with Chris. If you need a refresher, just go back to "Use Your Elevator Pitch on LinkedIn." Your summary should:

* Be written in first person, with a professional but conversational tone.
* Include your key abilities and contributions.
* Include 5 key skills (programming languages, software, etc.) for SEO purposes.

For reference, here's Chris's summary:
