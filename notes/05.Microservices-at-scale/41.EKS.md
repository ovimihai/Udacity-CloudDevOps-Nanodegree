In the previous section, you learner how to install and use the Kubernetes in your local machine. This section will guide you on using the AWS EKS service for creating and using the Kubernetes cluster.

**Once created, interacting with the Kubernetes cluster will remain the same on the AWS or local machine.**

Noet that creating a cluster and deploying an application are two separate things. First, we will learn to create a cluster. Later in this lesson, we will deploy a sample Python application to it. Like any other AWS service, an EKS cluster can be created using either of the following:

* Web console
* AWS CLI tool

We will learn to create a cluster using both the ways - web console and AWS CLI tool. Let's start with making you familiar with the web console.

## Exercise

Create an EKS cluster and a node group comprising of two nodes.
> 
> **Spoiler**: If you face difficulties in this exercise, the following pages will explain how to run a single command to create an AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster.

## Guided Instructions - Use the web-console

The exercise has three main parts:

### Part 1\. Prerequisites

1. **Default VPC and subnets**: A default VPC comprises a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block, providing up to 65,536 private IPv4 addresses. It automatically creates a size /20 default subnet in each Availability Zone. There are other components, such as default route tables, and internet gateway that are also created automatically. Go to the [VPC service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home) and check if you have a default VPC already set up in your account. (See the snapshot below). If no, refer to the [Creating a default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#create-default-vpc) instructions.

A default VPC

1. **IAM role for the cluster**: A role is a set of permissions that can be assigned to an entity. You need to create the roles that your cluster and the node group will assume. To create a new role, go to the [IAM service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) → Roles, and follow the steps below.

**Create the role that the cluster (control plane) will assume in order to manage AWS resources on your behalf.**
  * Click on the **Create role** button to start the wizard.
  * Choose _AWS service_ as the **trusted entity**.
  * Click on the _EKS_ to see EKS **use cases**. (See the snapshot below)
  * Choose **EKS - Cluster**. It will allow access to other AWS service resources that are required to operate clusters managed by EKS. Click Next.
  * The needed policy, `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`, will be selected. This policy provides Kubernetes the permissions it requires to manage resources on your behalf.
  * Click Next, and ignore the Tags.
  * Click Next, and name the role something like _myEKSClusterRole_

![Screenshot showing use case options for EKS, highlighting EKS - Cluster in orange](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609ba946_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-3.30.22-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-3.30.22-pm.png)

Select the **EKS - Cluster** use case while creating a role.

1. **IAM role for the worker nodes**: Create a new role, say _myEKSWorkerNodeRole_, that will give permissions to the _kubelet_ running on the worker node to make calls to other APIs on your behalf. Follow the similar procedure as above, except choosing the **EC2** use case instead of EKS. Also, in the **Attach permissions policies** section on the next page, search and choose the checkbox against the following policies:
  * `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`
  * `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`
  * `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`

Finish creating the role. Need help? See the [reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html#create-worker-node-role).

1. **SSH key pair**: AWS generates a pair of RSA encrypted public and private keys that help log into the EC2 instance (virtual machines). The public key is placed automatically on the EC2 instances, whereas you use the private key instead of a password to access your instances securely. To create the key pair, go to the [**EC2 service**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?)**→ Network & Security → Key Pairs** option on the left navigation tree.
  * Click on the **Create key pair** button.
  * Provide a name of your choice and choose the desired format. A _.pem_ format is used by Mac/Linux users, and a _.ppk_ format is used by Windows users.
  * It will download the private key file to your local.

![Screenshot showing options to create a key pair, highlighting the name field and the use of pem as the file format, for use with OpenSSH](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bacea_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-3.52.17-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-3.52.17-pm.png)

Create an SSH key pair

### Part 2\. Create an EKS Cluster

An EKS cluster comprises of:

* A **control plane** consists of the nodes running the Kubernetes software, such as _etcd_ and the Kubernetes API server. These components run in AWS-owned accounts.
* A **data plane** made up of worker nodes. Worker nodes run in customer accounts.
> 
> Once your control plane is ready, you can attach a set of worker nodes to the control plane for running the pods. Let's create the control plane (EKS cluster) first.

Navigate to the **[EKS service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home) → Amazon EKS → Clusters** option on the left navigation tree. Click on the **Create cluster** button to launch the wizard, and use the following details:

1. **Cluster configuration** - Provide a name of your choice, say _myEKSCluster_, and choose the default Kubernetes version. Ensure to have selected the IAM role you created above. The cluster, after assuming the role, will manage AWS resources on your behalf.

![Cluster configuration showing name, Kubernetes version, and the cluster service role](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bb1c8_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.15.04-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.15.04-pm.png)

Cluster configuration

1. **Specify networking** - Choose the **default** VPC, subnets, and security group (firewall rules) you have in your account, and mark the cluster endpoints as publicly accessible.

![Screenshot of Networking options, highlighting VPC info, subnets, security groups, and the Cluster endpoint access as Public](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bb38d_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.22.00-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.22.00-pm.png)

Specify networking

![Error showing cannot create cluster because the targeted availability zone does not currently have sufficient capacity. This is a known issue.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bb509_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.28.10-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.28.10-pm.png)

Known issue

1. **Configure logging** - Accept the defaults and create the cluster. It will take several minutes to create the cluster.

### Part 3\. Create a Node Group
> 
> A Node Group is a set of worker nodes (virtual machines) used to run the pods that your cluster will be serving.

Follow the steps below to create a Node Group and attach it to the Cluster:

1. Once your cluster shows an **Active** state, click on the cluster name to view more details.

![Screenshot showing a cluster, including name, kubernetes version, and status (Active)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bbb0d_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.54.39-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.54.39-pm.png)

An **Active** cluster

1. Go to the **Configuration → Compute** section of your new cluster, and click on the **Add Node Group** button.

![Screenshot showing how to add node group following the instructions provided above](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bbbce_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.57.32-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-4.57.32-pm.png)

The **Add Node Group** button.

1. **Node Group configuration**: Provide a name, and attach the _myEKSWorkerNodeRole_ IAM role to the Node Group. According to AWS,
> 
> The IAM Role will give permissions to the _kubelet_ running on the node to make calls to other APIs on your behalf.

![Screenshot showing node group configuration, highlighting name and IAM Role](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/May/609bc20c_screenshot-2021-05-12-at-5.23.17-pm/screenshot-2021-05-12-at-5.23.17-pm.png)

Node Group configuration

1. **Node Group compute and scaling configuration**: In this section, you choose the OS, (virtual) hardware configuration, and count of the worker nodes. Use the following values:

**Field****Value****Purpose**
