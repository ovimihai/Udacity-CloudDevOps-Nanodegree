## Exercise: Locust Load Testing
Load testing is a critical part of developing a reliable Microservice. This allows you to verify that the application can perform at scale. In this exercise, you will set up a basic load test with locust.

### Creating a Locust Loadtest with Flask

One powerful way to create a simple loadtest is with Locust and Flask. Here is an example of a simple flask hello world app. The [entire source code is found here](https://github.com/noahgift/docker-flask-locust).
    
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
``` 

The loadtest file is very simple to configure. Notice the `index` function calls into the main, and only flask route.
    
```python
from locust import HttpLocust, TaskSet, between

def index(l):
    l.client.get("/")

class UserBehavior(TaskSet):
    tasks = {index: 1}

class WebsiteUser(HttpLocust):
    task_set = UserBehavior
    wait_time = between(5.0, 9.0)
```

The login screen requires the number of users and also hostname and port. In our case this will be the port 8080\.

You can see how locust works when it runs.
