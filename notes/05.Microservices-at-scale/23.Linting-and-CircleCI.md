## Linting and CircleCI

### Extending a Makefile for use with Docker Containers

Beyond the simple `Makefile`, it is also useful to extend it to do other things. An example of this is as follows:

#### Example Makefile for Docker and CircleCI

```
setup:
    python3 -m venv ~/.container-revolution-devops

install:
    pip install --upgrade pip &&\
        pip install -r requirements.txt

test:
    #python -m pytest -vv --cov=myrepolib tests/*.py
    #python -m pytest --nbval notebook.ipynb

validate-circleci:
    # See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#processing-a-config
    circleci config process .circleci/config.yml

run-circleci-local:
    # See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#running-a-job
    circleci local execute

lint:
    hadolint demos/flask-sklearn/Dockerfile
    pylint --disable=R,C,W1203,W1202 demos/**/**.py

all: install lint test
``` 

A `Dockerfile` linter is called [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) checks for bugs in a `Dockerfile`. A [local version of the CircleCI build system](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/) allows for testing in the same environment as the SaaS offering. The minimalist approach is still present. A user only needs to remember to use the same commands: `make install`, `make lint` and `make test`, but the `lint` step is more complete and powerful with the inclusion of `Dockerfile` as well as `Python` linting.

_Notes about installing `hadolint` and `circleci`:_ If you are on OS X you can `brew install hadolint`. If you are on another platform follow the instructions from [the `hadolint` GitHub repo](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/). To install the local version of `circleci` on OS X or Linux you can run `curl -fLSs https://circle.ci/cli | bash` or follow the official instructions for [local version of the CircleCI build system](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/).

### CircleCI lint workflow

You can find Noah's code [here](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/tree/master/Lesson-2-Docker-format-containers/class-demos). Note that the `Makefile` used in the video is the one in the `class-demos` directory, while he changes into the subdirectory within `demos` after that.

### Using CircleCI

Here are the steps Noah took in the above video:

* Added to the Makefile:
    
```
validate-circleci:
    circleci config process .circleci/config.yml

run-circleci-local:
    circleci local execute

lint: # This line should already be there with regular pylint
    hadolint path/to/Dockerfile
``` 

* Runs `hadolint Dockerfile`
* Uses the `config.yml` file within a `.circleci` directory
* In the parent directory, runs `make run-circleci-local` to simulate what will happen in the remote CircleCI environment
* Uses the CircleCI website (a related blog post is linked below) to test remotely

### Notes about how to run this example

These instructions work the best on a Linux or OS X system or inside a Docker container itself. One way to dramatically simplify installation and configuration in the Cloud is to use a Cloud based development environment like AWS Cloud9\. This was shown in the AWS Lambda examples in Lesson 1\. This allows you to eliminate a huge portion of the problems you can run into when installing software. If you are expert at installing software on Linux, Windows or OS X, then this may not matter. If you want the easiest path to running these commands, use AWS Cloud9\.
