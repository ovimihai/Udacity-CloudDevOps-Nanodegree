## What is AWS Lambda?

Exercises https://github.com/ovimihai/DevOps_Microservices

AWS Lambda is a new category of computing where business logic can be directly deployed to a production environment without thinking about servers. Another word for this is serverless or FaaS (Function As A Service). Some of the benefits of AWS Lambda include no servers to manage, continuous scaling, and billing at the sub-second level.

Another benefit of AWS Lambda includes being part of an ecosystem designed to exploit the capability. Here are two examples of AWS Lambda. The first example is AWS Step Functions. They build upon AWS Lambda to create more sophisticated workflows like polling for a job to finish and performing an action. The second example is AWS DeepLens (a computer vision device). It uses AWS Lambda to serve out predictions. Finally, if you look closely, almost every service on AWS can utilize AWS Lambda.

The AWS ecosystem allows Lambda functions to respond to events instead of constantly running. This is similar to a motion detector that turns on a light in the garage. The duration the light may run for could be only a few hours per year. If the light switch was manually triggered it is possible the light would be run constantly for 365 days in the year.

The AWS Lambda ecosystem allows integration with other core services in AWS through triggers. An example of a trigger would be a movie file that is uploaded to Amazon S3 storage. An AWS Lambda function could be triggered that uses an AWS API to transcode the movie file to a different code or to add captioning.

> **Note**: AWS is continuously redesigning its user interface (UI) across most services (including Cloud9) and releasing new screens periodically. The information available on any new screen will be the same as the older one; only the layout may change slightly.

Here the steps demonstrated in the video above:

1. **Allow Cloud9 to access the Github repo**: The supporting material for this course is present in this Github repo [https://github.com/udacity/DevOps\_Microservices](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices) . If you want your Cloud9 environment to be able to write/push to the Github repo, you will have to generate an SSH key pair (public and private) in the Cloud9 terminal and save the public key in the Github repo settings.
    
    # Generate a pair of SSH keys, if you want your Cloud9 env to be able to push changes to the Github repo ssh-keygen -t rsa # View the contents of the public key cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

Open the Github repo [https://github.com/udacity/DevOps\_Microservices](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices) in a separate browser tab, and fork it into your account.Save the public key, content of _/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub_ file, in the Github \>\> Settings \>\> SSH & GPG keys.

1. **Clone** the forked repo into the Cloud9 environment using:
    
    git clone https://github.com/[Your-username]/DevOps_Microservices.git # The instructor uses his personal repo instead. # It's https://github.com/noahgift/awslambda.git 

1. \[Optional\] **Increase the Cloud9 memory limits**: Run the _resize.sh_ script present in this [folder](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/tree/master/Supporting-material) to increase the Cloud9 available-memory limits.
    
    cd DevOps_Microservices/Supporting-material # The instructor shows `cd awslambda` per hierarchy of his personal repo df -h chmod +x resize.sh ./resize.sh df -h cd .. 

1. **Initialize a new Lambda function**
    
    sam init 

Choose the following options in the prompts that appear next:

**Prompt****Recommended Response**

Template sourceAWS quick start template

Package typeImage artifact

Base imageamazon/python3.8-base

Project nameYour choice of the \[Application-name\]

AWS quick start application templateHello world Lambda image example

See the prompts in the snapshot below.

Change the directory to view the new files.

1. **Build the Hello World application**
    
    # Check the [Application-name]/README file instructions cd [Application-name] sam build 

The command above will Dockerize the Lambda function in the Cloud9 environment. You can view the _\[Application-name\]/hello world/app.py_ file to see the expected output when you'll run the app.

1. **Run the application locally (in Cloud9)**
    
    sam local invoke 

The command will build the image locally, and run the container.

1. **Deploy the application to an ECR image repository**
    
    # Create a cloudformation stack to deploy the application image in the ECR image repository sam deploy --guided 

Provide responses the the prompts that appear next. **Note**: AWS has updated the behavior of this command to create an image repository in the ECR service automatically, if not already available. This command will push the the Docker image from local (Cloud9) to the ECR service.

The `sam deploy --guided` command will create a Cloudformation stack comprising of an IAM role, Lambda function, and an API Gateway.

1. **Test**: After successful execution, it will generate an API gateway endpoint URL that you can `curl` or paste in a browser tab to see the function output.
    
    curl [API gateway endpoint URL]

## Deploying and Testing

### Operationalizing AWS Lambda

Continuing with the analogy of a motion-sensing light in the garage, imagine if there were many things that could turn on the light in the garage. What are some triggers that could be set up to turn on the light in the garage?

* Opening of the garage door
* Home burglar alarm
* A nightly timer that starts at 8 PM and ends at 8 AM

Just like the home automation example, there are many ways to trigger a Lambda function. One of the most common ways to trigger the Lambda function would be through API Gateway. A web service is created by adding API Gateway to the lambda, and then, if the URL is requested by a browser or an API call, it would, in turn, trigger the Lambda function.

Another common way to trigger the AWS Lambda function would be to attach it to Amazon S3\. Instead of the Lambda function being triggered from the web service, it could be triggered every time a new file is placed in an S3 bucket. Yet another trigger could be a CloudWatch Event Timer. A timer could be set up to run every hour. At the top of each hour, the Lambda function would be called.

Let's get into a real-world example now. A company that needs to collect a competitor's pricing, say for a similar washing machine they are selling, could create a Lambda function that scrapes the competitor's website. Next, a CloudWatch Event timer could run nightly to scrape the website and put the results into an S3 bucket. When the S3 bucket receives the HTML results, a second AWS Lambda function could be triggered that extracts the pricing information from the HTML file and writes it to DynamoDB, if it is lower than the current value in the database. Finally, the website itself could host a third AWS Lambda function that uses API Gateway to serve out the companies current prices, which will always be at least the same price or lower than their competitors.

**Comparison of Light Bulb in Garage Triggers vs AWS Lambda Triggers**

When a car approaches a traffic light, they can expect signals to output many things: turn left, stop (red), slow (yellow), go (green). Sometimes if there is a problem with the light, it may flash red. Websites and APIs work in a similar fashion. There are codes (signals) that are returned that indicate what a web request is doing:

* 1xx (request received and processing)
* 2xx (request successful)
* 3xx (redirection)
* 4xx (client error
* 5xx (server error)

In practice this comes into play when testing an application or setting up alerts. For monitoring that an error code that had, say 500 would signal a problem and a 200 would be a success.

### Events & Response

Event-handling and creating a response are really important aspects of Functions as a Service. Take these quizzes to gauge how well you understand these aspects.

**Prompt****Recommended Response**

Template sourceAWS quick start template

Package typeImage artifact

Base imageamazon/python3.8-base

Project nameYour choice of the \[Application-name\]

AWS quick start application templateHello world Lambda image example

Notice the directory for the newly initiated Lambda function.

Initiate a Lambda function in the Cloud9 environment

1. **Update app.py** - Copy the code present in the [wikipedia\_lambda\_exercise.py](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/blob/master/Lesson-1-Lambda-functions/wikipedia-query/wikipedia_lambda_exercise.py) file and paste it into the _HelloWiki/hello\_world/app.py_ file. There are some simple ToDo items for you in the _wikipedia\_lambda\_exercise.py_ file. If you need help, you can refer/copy the [wikipedia\_lambda\_solution.py](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/blob/master/Lesson-1-Lambda-functions/wikipedia-query/wikipedia_lambda_solution.py) code.

Updating the _app.py_ file

1. **Update requirement.txt** - Edit the _HelloWiki/hello\_world/requirement.txt_ file to include the depdendencies needed by the new application.
    
    requests wikipedia 

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**  

    cd HelloWiki/hello world python3 -m venv ~/.wiki source ~/.wiki/bin/activate python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

![Create a virtual environment and install dependencies](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/December/61a76033_screenshot-2021-12-01-at-5.13.27-pm/screenshot-2021-12-01-at-5.13.27-pm.png)

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

1. **Create payload.json file** - Create a test payload (JSON) in the _HelloWiki/_ Lambda function directory, that will pass an `entity` as a _request_ to your function.
    
    { "entity":"twitter" } 

Once you get that working (later), feel free to try new values such as, `Python_(programming_language)`.

1. **Build the application**
    
    # Check the HelloWiki/README file instructions # Assuming you have updated the app.py, and requirement.txt # Assumnig you have created the HelloWiki/payload.json file # Ensure that you are in the HelloWiki/ directory sam build 

The command above will Dockerize the Lambda function in the Cloud9 environment. You can view the _\[Application-name\]/hello world/app.py_ file to see the expected output when you'll run the app.

1. Run the application locally in the Cloud9 environment:
    
    # Ensure that you are in the HelloWiki/ directory sam local invoke -e payload.json 

Further, you can deploy the app to the ECR image repository. After deployment, you'd see the Lambda function in the AWS explorer panel.

![Successfully running the application](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/December/61a76691_screenshot-2021-12-01-at-5.40.30-pm/screenshot-2021-12-01-at-5.40.30-pm.png)

Successfully running the application

### Optional Challenge

You would notice that the `wikipedia` package may give yuo results for the the ambiguous keywords, such as `amazon`. Too resolve this issue can you update the app.py to utilize the [Wikipedia-API](https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/) package? Refer to this [README](https://github.com/martin-majlis/Wikipedia-API) for example usage.
