## Exercise: Deploying to Amazon ECR

With a build server, local Docker file and lint files, we have everything built for our Python environment. The final step is to get this environment & microservice we've created deployed into an Amazon environment. We'll use Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to do so. This allows us to put the whole bundled container and application onto Amazon.

In the below video, Noah walks through the steps necessary to deploy to Amazon ECR. You can follow along with the video, or additionally follow the exercise steps at the bottom of the page.

All cloud providers also have their own container registries. These are important because they allow you to keep private containers that will be sourced for cloud-based deployments.

### Instructions

* Create an empty `Dockerfile` using the `touch` command, or use a previously existing `Dockerfile`
  * Use the `FROM` directive to source Python as a base image: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python)
  * Build your container locally
* Create a new ECR repository following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_GetStarted.html).
* Push your container to the ECR repository you created
