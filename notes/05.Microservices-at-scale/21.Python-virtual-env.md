_Note_: You will need the `virtualenv` package installed to use `venv`. On a Mac, you may need to either `pip install` or `conda install` it depending on `which python3` path you use.

Below are the steps again to refresh your memory! In the steps below, `venv` is the name of the environment created, but you can name the environment anything you want.

* Create a Python3 virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
* Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
* Upgrade `pip` if you need to (optional): `pip install --upgrade pip`
* Install `pylint`: `pip install pylint`
* Install the code formatting tool `black`: `pip install black`
* Install the testing library `pytest`: `pip install pytest`
* Install the interactive interpreter `ipython`: `pip install ipython`
* Test it out by typing `ipython` and running some code
