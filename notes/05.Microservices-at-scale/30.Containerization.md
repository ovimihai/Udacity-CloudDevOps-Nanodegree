## Exercise: Docker-based Apps

If you haven't already, clone the course repository - [DevOps\_Microservices](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices), and navigate to the **Lesson-3-Containerization** directory. You'll use the code there to containerize a pre-built application with Docker.

### Instructions

* Navigate to the **Lesson-3-Containerization** directory in the [Github repo](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices).

* Check out the pre-built [Flask app](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/tree/master/Lesson-3-Containerization/flask_app) that will be containerized. If you haven't used Flask before, you can check out [this free Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088), or check out [Flask's documentation](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).

* Look through the `Dockerfile` for the container (also included below).

* Look through the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/blob/master/Lesson-3-Containerization/Makefile) to be run within the container.

The only real new thing so far is the inclusion of the Flask app - you got familiar with Dockerfiles and Makefiles in the _Using Docker Format Containers_ Lesson, as well as how to create them. There are some additional steps we still want to go through to get the App up and running, but the important thing to notice here is that it doesn't necessarily matter what the application itself is, you can still easily containerize it.

### Noah's Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` in Noah's video is provided below:

```
FROM python:3.7.3-stretch

# Working Directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source code to working directory
COPY . flask_app/web.py /app/

# Install packages from requirements.txt
# hadolint ignore=DL3013
RUN pip install --upgrade pip &&\
    pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py at container launch
CMD ["python", "web.py"]
```

### Hint

To run this code you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed. Remember the suggestion about using AWS Cloud9? It has Docker already installed for you. This may be a time to try this out and see if this workflow simplifies the way you work.

Copying An Application

Make sure to add the additional line to your Dockerfile before moving on!

`COPY . nlib /app/`

The updated Dockerfile should look like this:

``` 
FROM python:3.7.3-stretch

# Working Directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source code to working directory
COPY . flask_app/web.py /app/
COPY . nlib /app/

# Install packages from requirements.txt
# hadolint ignore=DL3013
RUN pip install --upgrade pip &&\
    pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py at container launch
CMD ["python", "web.py"]
```

### More on Ports

Ports are not usually just randomly assigned numbers. Many ports are used for specific activities in networking. Port 80 is the commonly used port number for HTTP requests, which is why we are exposing that port to the host computer - it's where the Flask app is listening for requests. You may also see other ports, such as port 8080, used with different applications. What this means is that the server is listening on that port, so a request to that server must also append the "special" port number to an HTTP request (such as example.website.com:8080), so that the sending client uses port 8080, instead of the normal HTTP port 80\.

You can see some additional common ports [here](https://www.utilizewindows.com/list-of-common-network-port-numbers/).

## App Start

### Common Issues Running a Container

There are a few common issues that crop up when starting a container or building one for the first time. Let's walk through each problem and then present a solution for them.

#### What Goes in a `Dockerfile` if You Need to [Write to the Host Filesystem](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)?

In the following example the `docker volume` command is used to create a volume and then later it is mounted to the container.
    
``` 
>  /tmp docker volume create docker-data
docker-data
>  /tmp docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               docker-data
>  /tmp docker run -d \
  --name devtest \
  --mount source=docker-data,target=/app \
  ubuntu:latest
6cef681d9d3b06788d0f461665919b3bf2d32e6c6cc62e2dbab02b05e77769f4
``` 

#### How Do You [Configure Logging](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/) for a Docker Container?

You can configure logging for a Docker container by selecting the type of log driver, in this example `json-file`, and whether it is blocking or non-blocking. This example shows a configuration that uses `json-file` and `mode=non-blocking` for an Ubuntu container. The `non-blocking` mode ensures that the application won't fail in a non-deterministic manner. Make sure to read the [Docker logging guide](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/) on different logging options.
```
> /tmp docker run -it --log-driver json-file --log-opt mode=non-blocking ubuntu root@551f89012f30:/#
```    

#### How do You Map Ports to the External Host?

The Docker container has an internal set of ports that [must be exposed to the host and mapped](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/port/). One of the easiest ways to see what ports are exposed to the host is by running the `docker port <container name>` command. Here is an example of what that looks like against a `foo` named container.
    
```
$ docker port foo
7000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:2000
9000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:3000
``` 

What about actually mapping the ports? You can do that using the `-p` flag as shown. You can read more about [Docker `run` flags here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).
    
    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:9999/tcp ubuntu bash 

#### What about Configuring Memory, CPU and GPU?

You can configure docker `run` to accept flags for setting Memory, CPU and GPU. You can read [more about it here](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/) in the official documentation. Here is a brief example of setting the CPU.
    
    docker run -it --cpus=".25" ubuntu /bin/bash 

This tells this container to use at max only 25% of the CPU every second.

## Exercise: Containerize an App

Containers are a powerful mechanism to reuse code from experts. Test your knowledge of the power of containers in the following exercise by building a container and containerizing an app from scratch!

### Instructions

* Create an empty `Dockerfile` using the `touch` command
* Use the `FROM` command and reference the latest version of Python [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/python).
* Include the ["Hello World" Flask example](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) as an app within your container
  * Copy any relevant directories and libraries in the `Dockerfile`
  * Make sure any relevant requirements are installed in the `Dockerfile`
  * Expose the port from the Flask example oin the `Dockerfile` - make sure you check which one is used by the example!
  * Have your `Dockerfile` run the relevant commands for your app
* Build your container
* Run the container, opening up a bash shell
* Verify the correct version of Python is installed: `python --version`

### Tips

Below are potential options for building and running your container.

To build your container, if tagging your container as `my-python-app`:

* `$ docker build -t my-python-app .`

To run the container, given `my-python-app` as the image tag and `my-running-app` as the container name:

* `$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app`
