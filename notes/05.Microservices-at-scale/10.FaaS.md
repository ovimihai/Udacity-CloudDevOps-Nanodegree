## Lesson Outline

In this lesson, you'll learn to deploy serverless applications, using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). This lesson breaks up the topic of serverless applications into smaller concepts:

* What are Functions as a Service (FaaS)?
* Characteristics of cloud-native applications
* Creating an AWS Lambda function using Cloud9
* Responding to events, such as HTTP **requests**
* Creating a JSON **response**

Request-response cycle

### Request-Response

Much of this lesson will rely on creating and understanding the **request-response** method of computer communication. From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response):

"**Request--response** ... is one of the basic methods computers use to _communicate_ with each other, in which the first computer sends a request for some data and the second responds to the request. Usually, there is a series of such interchanges until the complete message is sent; browsing a web page is an example of request--response communication.

**Request--response can be seen as a telephone call, in which someone is called and they answer the call.**"

In this lesson, requests are typically HTTP requests with some input data, and a response will be a JSON-formatted set of output values.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have all the skills you need to develop and deploy serverless functions of your own design!

## Functions as a Service (FaaS)

### What is AWS Lambda?

From the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html):

"AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code **without provisioning or managing servers**."

* "AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
* You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running."

"You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events," such as HTTP requests.

### SQS Queue

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.

* A **queue** is just a type of list that orders data in a particular way; typically in a first-item-in = first-item-out order (FIFO), as shown below.

### MXNet and Lambda

* Learn more about deploying models using MXNet and AWS Lambda in [this AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/seamlessly-scale-predictions-with-aws-lambda-and-mxnet/), where they link to a repository of example code!

## A Model for Serverless

### Models for Serverless

Though we'll be using AWS cloud tools, there are a number of other providers that you can use to build serverless applications with auto-scaling capabilities. The skills you learn in this lesson will be widely applicable to these other platforms. Some of the larger, cloud providers include:

* Amazon Web Services \[ [Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice) & [Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\]
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/?pli=1)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

And you are welcome to check these out, especially if you have a platform that you already prefer.

## Benefits of FaaS

### Why FaaS?

* Higher developer ROI because server infrastructure management no longer required.
* More time focused on writing code, which leads to a higher developer velocity.
* Functional programming is a design well suited to distributed computing. Instead of scaling your entire application, you can scale your functions automatically and independently with usage.
