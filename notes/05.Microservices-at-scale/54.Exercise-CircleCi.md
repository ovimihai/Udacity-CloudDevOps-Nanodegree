## Exercise: CircleCI

It is easy to look at build servers as a nice to have when they are a must-have for DevOps best practices. One ubiquitous cloud-based build server is CircleCI. In this exercise, you will incorporate many of the concepts from this course: Docker, Makefiles, and build systems.

### Instructions

* Create and use an [AWS Cloud9 environment](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/). (We also have a video tutorial in a previous lesson.)
* Change the template below and add to your `Makefile` (this template is similar to what we used in earlier lessons).
* Install `hadolint` by [downloading it here](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/tag/v1.17.5).
* Run `make lint` and make sure you are able to lint both Python code and a `Dockerfile`
* _Optional_ Setup CircleCI integration. Remember you can also refer back to the Docker setup screencast in Lesson 4 to see more ideas on `hadolint`.

#### Makefile template

```yaml
setup:
    python3 -m venv ~/.udacity-devops

install:
    pip install --upgrade pip &&\
        pip install -r requirements.txt

test:
    #python -m pytest -vv --cov=myrepolib tests/*.py
    #python -m pytest --nbval notebook.ipynb


lint:
    hadolint demos/flask-sklearn/Dockerfile
    pylint --disable=R,C,W1203 demos/**/**.py

all: install lint test
```
