## Monitoring, Logging and Debugging with Kubernetes

https://youtu.be/li1XFcv0W80

We covered Prometheus more in-depth in the previous course, so we'll focus more on how it integrates with Kubernetes here.

The [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) helps to integrate Prometheus monitoring directly with Kubernetes. There is also the [`kube-prometheus`](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus) package which includes additional helpful components (including the Prometheus Operator) for monitoring, as well as the [Prometheus Adapter](https://github.com/directxman12/k8s-prometheus-adapter).

Prometheus is not the only monitoring tool available for Kubernetes though - if you are interested in other options as well, check out this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/).

On the next page, you'll get to perform an exercise to get monitoring set up with Prometheus, as well as think through designing a monitoring system of your own.

### Reference

* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
* [Application Introspection and Debugging](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application-introspection/)

## Exercise: Prometheus Monitoring

Monitoring is an essential component of DevOps best practices. In this exercise, you will set up Prometheus Monitoring.

### Alerting Theory

For this exercise you will:

* Set up Prometheus monitoring.
* Consider a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), "[six sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma_)" and the [68-95-99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule). Computer systems events are often normally distributed, meaning that all events within three standard deviations from the mean occur with 99.7 of the occurrences.
* Design a process that alerts senior engineers when events are greater than three standard deviations from the mean and write up how the alerts should work, i.e.
  * Who should get a page when an event is more significant than three standard deviants from the mean?
  * Should there be a backup person who gets alerted if the first person doesn't respond within five minutes?
  * Should an alert wake up a team member at one standard deviation? What about two?

## Getting Started with Prometheus

https://youtu.be/PStcuwCJtq0

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a popular metrics and alerting solution that is often used with containers and Kubernetes. To run this tutorial please do the following.

* Use a local environment or preferably AWS Cloud9\. If you use AWS Cloud9, you will need to expose port 9090 via EC2 Security Group.
* [Download, install](https://prometheus.io/download/) and run Prometheus. On AWS Cloud9 you would install the latest release that has `*.linux-amd64.tar.gz` in the name. This would like something like `wget <some release>.linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
    
    tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
    cd prometheus-* 

* Configure Prometheus by creating a `prometheus.yml` file
    
```bash
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
``` 

* Start Prometheus

Wait about 30 seconds for Prometheus to collect data.
    
    ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml 

* View data through the expression browser

Go to [http://localhost:9090/graph](http://localhost:9090/graph). Choose the "console" within the graph. One metric that Prometheus collects is how many times [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics) has been called. If you refresh a few times then type the following in the expression console you can see a time series result.
    
    promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total 

* View data through the graphing interface

Another way to view data is via the graphing interface. Go to [http://localhost:9090/graph](http://localhost:9090/graph). Use the "Graph" tab.
    
    rate(promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total{code="200"}[1m]) 

* _(OPTIONAL)_ Going further, feel free to experiment with how that would work by following the example below and changing to suite your needs.

A more sophisticated example would [involve also collecting](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#downloading-and-running-prometheus) data from clients. Next download these `go` clients using the code below and run them.
    
```bash
# Fetch the client library code and compile example.
git clone https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang.git
cd client_golang/examples/random
go get -d
go build

# Start 3 example targets in separate terminals:
./random -listen-address=:8080
./random -listen-address=:8081
./random -listen-address=:8082
``` 

Next, add these clients in the `prometheus.yml`
    
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name:       'example-random'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080', 'localhost:8081']
        labels:
          group: 'production'

      - targets: ['localhost:8082']
        labels:
          group: 'canary'
``` 

Restart prometheus and view this metric in the expression browser.

`rpc_durations_seconds`.

## Exercise: Logging

Logging is an important concept to master for professional software development. Test your skills in this exercise by getting the logs from a running pod.

### Instructions

* Start your kubernetes application
* Grab your application logs for your pod (given a pod named `my-pod`) by running this command: `kubectl logs my-pod`

It's that easy to gather your logs with Kubernetes!
