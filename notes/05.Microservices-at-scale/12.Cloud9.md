## AWS Console & Cloud9 Environment

The majority of work that you do in this lesson will be completed using [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/), which lets you code, run, and debug code in your browser! For certain exercises, you will be expected to work through a Cloud9 environment, which has access to all the libraries we need as well as data management and deployment tools!

## Set up a Cloud9 Environment

Then, you'll need to set up a Cloud9 environment that is connected to the [main Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices) for this course. This environment will be the primary way in which we interact with the Cloud9 ecosystem.

## Follow Along
It is suggested that you follow along with these videos by having this classroom open in one tab and opening up a separate tab for environment creation and coding.

## Tutorial: Making Change

### Prerequisites

* You should have a Cloud9 environment running already in a separate browser tab.
* You must have cloned the Github repo in the Cloud9 environment and navigate to the folder contaning the exercise code.
    
    # Clone the repo if not already git clone https://github.com/[Your-username]/DevOps_Microservices.git # Navigate to the folder contaning the exercise code cd DevOps_Microservices/Lesson-1-Lambda-functions/make-change-tutorial 

![Files in the *DevOps_Microservices/Lesson-1-Lambda-functions/make-change-tutorial* directory. <br> You will use the *make_change.py* file in the instructions below.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/61a625f8_screenshot-2021-11-30-at-6.47.53-pm/screenshot-2021-11-30-at-6.47.53-pm.png)

Files in the _DevOps\_Microservices/Lesson-1-Lambda-functions/make-change-tutorial_ directory.  
You will use the _make\_change.py_ file in the instructions below.

### Exercise Overview

Now, you're ready to deploy a more complex Function as a Service (FaaS). The next interactive tutorial will be about event-handling for a function that automatically makes the smallest amount of change given an input amount of US currency. For example, given $0.63, the function should output: 2 quarters, 1 dime, 3 pennies.

### Instructions

* Create a new AWS Lambda function or use an existing function in the Cloud9 environment. Assuming the app name is _HelloWorldLambda_, double-click to open the _HelloWorldLambda/hello\_world/app.py_ file. See the file path in the snapshot below.

![Path to the Lambda function's *app.py* file. <br> Double click on the *app.py* filename to open it in the editor.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/61a6290e_screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.03.35-pm/screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.03.35-pm.png)

Path to the Lambda function's _app.py_ file.  
Double click on the _app.py_ filename to open it in the editor.

* **Update app.py** - Copy the code present in the [make\_change.py](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/blob/master/Lesson-1-Lambda-functions/make-change-tutorial/make_change.py) file and paste it into the _DevOps\_Microservices/HelloWorldLambda/hello\_world/app.py_ file. This _app.py_ file is the main file of the application.

![Copy the code from *make_change.py* to the *app.py* file.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/61a62acc_screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.12.49-pm/screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.12.49-pm.png)

Copy the code from _make\_change.py_ to the _app.py_ file.

* **Update requirement.txt** - Edit the _HelloWorldLambda/hello\_world/requirement.txt_ file to include the depdendencies needed by the new application.
    
    requests 

In the next exercise you will add newer dependency - `wikipedia`.

* **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**  
A virtual environment is an **isolated** Python environment having its own set of packages installed.
    
    cd [Application-name]/hello world python3 -m venv ~/.myvenv source ~/.myvenv/bin/activate python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

![Create a virtual environment and install dependencies](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/61a62cad_screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.20.38-pm/screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.20.38-pm.png)

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

* **Create payload.json file** - Write a test payload (JSON), passing in some $ `amount` as a _request_ to your function, and view the JSON response. The payload needs to be JSON formatted as
    
    { "amount":1.45 } 

Once you get that working (later), feel free to try new values by putting different amounts into the JSON payload. For example, `{"amount":1.50}`.

![Create a payload file. Notice the path carefully.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/61a630fb_screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.40.06-pm/screenshot-2021-11-30-at-7.40.06-pm.png)

Create a payload file. Notice the path carefully.

* [Run the application locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-invoke.html) in the Cloud9 environment:
    
    # Assuming you have updated the app.py, requirement.txt, # Assumnig you have created the [Application-name]/payload.json file cd [Lambda-function-name] sam build sam local invoke -e payload.json # If you were doing this development in your physical local machine and want to test more, use: sam local start-api # It will generate an API endpoint tha you can curl in s diiffernt terminal window.

### QUIZ QUESTION

Look at the JSON response to the requested amount of **1.42**, what is the exact format of the returned JSON response?

* {4: "quarters", 4: "dimes", 0: "nickels", 2: "pennies"}
* {5: "quarters", 2: "pennies", 1: "dime", 1: "nickel"}
* {5: "quarters", 1: "dimes", 1: "nickels", 2: "pennies"}
* {5: "quarters", 1: "dime", 1: "nickel", 2: "pennies"}

* **Deploy the app** - Deploy the newly created and tested lambda function.
    
    # Use the URI of the new ECR repo, if created manually sam deploy --guided # Go to AWS ECR and create a new repo to store the newly created custom image. 

After deployment, you'd see the Lambda function in the AWS explorer panel. You can also test it out in the AWS Lambda web console and make the function return the correct change. You can get inspiration on how to do that [here](https://youtu.be/AlRUeNFuObk). See the snapshots below that shows how to create a payload file and run the test.

## Optional Challenge

There are many ways you can build off of this simple function, as an additional challenge:

* See if you can make a similar function that calculates change in a different currency, such as in Mexican pesos.

* If you want to really challenge yourself, [build your own text translation AWS Lambda as shown here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaZqirmuBZM)

* See if you can write a different function that does currency conversion between two different currencies, at a current exchange rate.
