# Creating an EKS Cluster

Before we move further, note that there are multiple ways to create/delete an AWS EKS cluster, such as:

1. EKS web-console
2. CloudFormation console
3. EKSCTL utility - **Recommended way**

## Create an EKS Cluster using the EKSCTL utility

### 1\. Create command

Let's use `eksctl` and `kubectl` utilities to create a Kubernetes cluster in the AWS EKS. Run the following command to create the EKS cluster:
    
    eksctl create cluster --name eksctl-demo --region=us-east-2 [--profile <profile-name>] 

The command above will take a few minutes to execute, and create an EKS cluster "eksctl-demo" in the "us-east-1" region with:

* One node group containing two `m5.large` nodes
* Two subnets in separate availability zones
* Two separate CloudFormation stacks - **eksctl-eksctl-demo-cluster** for the cluster, and **eksctl-eksctl-demo-nodegroup-ng-7f9854c3** for the initial nodegroup

For more information on creating and managing clusters, refer [here](https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/).

### 2\. View progress

* Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to view progress. If you don't see any progress, be sure that you are viewing clusters in the same region that they are being created. For example, if `eksctl` is using region _us-east-2_, you'll need to set the region to _US East (Ohio)_ in the dropdown menu in the upper right of the console.

In case of issues, you can try:
    
    eksctl utils describe-stacks --region=us-east-2 --cluster=eksctl-demo [--profile <profile-name>]

Verify the region in the web-console.

CloudFormation stacks created as a part of EKSCTL command

### 3\. View details

* Once the status is CREATE\_COMPLETE in the CloudFormation web-console, fetching the details of the newly created cluster using:
    
    eksctl get cluster --name=eksctl-demo --region=us-east-2 [--profile <profile-name>] 

* Go back to the CloudFormation web console and select the `eksctl-eksctl-demo-cluster` stack. Select the tab **Template**, this shows you the Cloudformation template that `eksctl` command used to create your EKS cluster. The Cloudformation template describes all of the resources and connections between them that are needed for a cluster. We will discuss Cloudformation templates more later in the course.

* Click the **View in Designer** button. This will give you a visual representation of the resources that make up the stack created. Close and leave the designer.

EKSCTL internally uses the template above to create the CloudFormation stack.

* You can also check the health of your clusters nodes using the command:
    
    kubectl get nodes [--profile <profile-name>] 

> **Ask yourself**: Did you see the difference in the usage of `eksctl` vs `kubectl`? The former is used to create/delete/edit a cluster, whereas the latter is used to interact with the cluster.

### 4\. Deploy a Sample App

Let's deploy a sample [Python "Hello World"](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/tree/master/Lesson-3-Containerization/python-helloworld) app to the kubernetes cluster.
    
    # Assuming you have already cloned the course repo as git clone git clone https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices.git # Move to the exercise folder if you want to write Dockerfile from scratch cd DevOps_Microservices/Lesson-3-Containerization/python-helloworld 

Once you are in the right folder, run these commands and read the inline comments carefully.
    
    # Ensure Docker Desktop is running locally docker --version # Build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory docker build -t python-helloworld . docker images # Run a container docker run -d -p 5000:5000 python-helloworld # Check the output at http://localhost:5000/ or http://0.0.0.0:5000/ or http://127.0.0.1:5000/ docker ps # Now, stop the container. # Tag locally before pushing to the Dockerhub # We have used a sample Dockerhub profile /sudkul # Replace sudkul/ with your Dockerhub profile docker tag python-helloworld sudkul/python-helloworld:v1.0.0 docker images # Log into the Dockerhub from your local terminal docker login # Replace sudkul/ with your Dockerhub profile docker push sudkul/python-helloworld:v1.0.0 # Check the image in your Dockerhub online at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sudkul/python-helloworld 

Once your Docker image is publicly available, you can deploy it to the kubernetes cluster.
    
    # Assuming the Kubernetes cluster is ready kubectl get nodes # Deploy an App from the Dockerhub to the Kubernetes Cluster kubectl create deploy python-helloworld --image=sudkul/python-helloworld:v1.0.0 # See the status kubectl get deploy,rs,svc,pods # Port forward kubectl port-forward pod/python-helloworld-84857d9565-2598m --address 0.0.0.0 5000:5000 

Access the app locally at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
> 
> **Note** that the Kubernetes commands above are also valid if you are running the cluster locally.

### 5\. Delete the cluster

You can delete the cluster either from the CloudFormation web-console, or by using the EKSCTL command. Choose any one option from below:

* From the CloudFormation web-console, select your stack and choose delete from the actions menu
* Delete using the EKSCTL:
    
    eksctl delete cluster --region=us-east-2 --name=eksctl-demo [--profile <profile-name>] 

> Note: We recommend you shut down every resource (e.g., EC2 instances, CloudFormation stack, or any other hosted service) on the AWS cloud immediately after the usage; otherwise, you will be billed even if the resources are not in "actual" use.

![Using the `eksctl delete cluster` command to delete the cluster and all the associated resources. ](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2022/January/61eaa026_screenshot-2022-01-21-at-5.29.31-pm/screenshot-2022-01-21-at-5.29.31-pm.png)

Using the `eksctl delete cluster` command to delete the cluster and all the associated resources.

## Creating a EKS Cluster: Key Points

* eksctl makes it easy to create a cluster and all of the resources needed to use it
* kubectl communicates the clusters master system and can be used to interact with nodes, pods, and services
* When deleting a cluster, use `eksctl delete` or the CloudFormation console to avoid leaving dangling resources

### Summary of the CLI tools

Now that you have now been introduced to three command-line tools that you can use to work with AWS EKS services:

1. AWSCLI: This tool allows you to interact with a wide variety of AWS services, not just EKS. Although there are aws commands to create or modify EKS services, this is a much more manual approach than using the other options.
2. eksctl: This command line tool allows you to run commands against a Kubernetes cluster. This is the best tool for creating or deleting clusters from the command line since it will take care of all associated resources for you.
3. kubectl: This tool is used to interact with an existing cluster, but can't be used to create or delete a cluster.
