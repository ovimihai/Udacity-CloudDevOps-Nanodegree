### What is Cloud Native Computing?

According to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md):
> 
> Cloud Native computing empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

In simpler words, it is the ability to design, build, and run applications in the cloud, thereby utilizing the seemingly "infinite" compute, storage, and networking capacity and other inherent benefits of cloud computing.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

* **Cost**  
There is no up-front cost and resources can be precisely metered to meet demand.

* **Speed**  
The cloud offers self-service, so an expert user can leverage the resources to build solutions quickly.

* **Global scale**  
All major cloud providers have a global scale, which means services can be provisioned all over the world to meet demand in a geographic region.
* **Productivity**  
Many tasks, such as racking servers, configuring network hardware, and physically securing a data center, no longer exists. Companies can focus on building core intellectual property versus reinventing the wheel.
* **Performance**  
The performance of applications can leverage a continuous upgrade cycle. The network, the storage and the compute improve over time consistently. Additionally, Cloud-Native applications are able to leverage new capabilities in the cloud to further increase performance.
* **Reliability**  
The core architecture of the cloud offers redundancy at every step. There are multiple regions and multiple data centers in each region. Cloud-native architecture can design around these capabilities, leading to highly available architectures. Additionally, many-core cloud services are themselves highly available, like Amazon S3, which has nine nines, or 99.999999999% reliability.
* **Security**  
You are only as good as your weakest link with security. By consolidating to centralized security, a higher level of security occurs. Problems such as physical access to a data center or encryption at rest become industry standard on day one.

### Related Terms

The video above talks about the terms like Relational Database and Moore's Law. Let's have a quick look at the definition of these terms.

#### What is a Relational Database?

A [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) is a tabular system that stores a **finite** amount of information. You can think of a relational database as a spreadsheet of values/data, where each row in the spreadsheet has a unique ID.

#### What is Moore's Law?

The general premise of Moore's Law is "that the speed and capability of computers can be expected to double every two years, as a result of increases in the number of transistors a microchip can contain." - [Oxford dictionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mooreslaw.asp)

In 2015, Moore's Law was effectively over, and gains are at 3% a year. One of the most challenging areas of computer science is distributed computing. In the modern era of cloud computing, there are a few fundamental shifts that have changed everything. One of the most significant shifts is the rise of multicore machines and the end of Moore's Law.

Moore's Law exposed two fundamental problems that manifest themselves in the cloud era. The first problem is that CPUs are designed to be multipurpose processors. They are not specialized to run parallel workloads. If you couple that with the ultimate physical limits of increasing CPU speed, the CPU has become less critical in the cloud era.

The second problem is that making multiple core machines to counteract the limitations of single-processor speed has led to a ripple effect on software languages. Many languages previously had substantial problems taking advantage of multiple cores because they were designed in an era before multiple processors existed, let alone the internet. What makes things even more challenging is that there is "no free lunch" by adding more cores to a problem that is not mostly parallel.

## Characteristics of Cloud-Native Systems

https://youtu.be/AsWnzQ-5804

### What are Some Characteristics of Cloud-Native Systems?

#### Microservice oriented

Microservices more closely map business logic to code. These systems can be updated and developed independently. A good example of a Microservice architecture would be a Python AWS Lambda application that uses API Gateway.

#### Elastic

Elastic systems can automatically scale to meet increased load without the involvement of humans. These same systems can then scale down again when load diminishes. By eliminating human touchpoints, which are error-prone, the quality increases. Likewise, because the system can scale up and down for demand, it is more efficient to run and costs less.

#### Continuous Delivery

Cloud-native systems leverage IAC (infrastructure as code) to fully define the infrastructure. This means that deployment can target a dynamically created environment and that software can be automatically deployed to a new environment as it is created. Humans again are eliminated from the process of deployment increasing quality.

#### DevOps

Cloud-native systems utilize DevOps. DevOps is a combination of automation, processes, and tools that increase automation, collaboration, and operational efficiency. Using Python for DevOps is a common way this automation is achieved.

#### Agility

The agility of developing solutions improves. The cloud speeds up development time and increases quality through the use of IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and Continuous Delivery.

#### Composable

Cloud-Native solutions are highly composable. The service design is one of integration. At the minimum, each service has an Application Programming Interface (API) that is consistent and discoverable. Other traits include well-defined behaviors for registration, discovery, and request management.

#### Pros:

* Ability to leverage near infinite resources of the cloud: Compute, Disk I/O, Storage, and Memory.
* No up-front costs and resources can be metered to meet demand like an electric or water utility.
* Applications are able to "go global" immediately with no extra investment.
* Increased reliability is increased as many cloud services are themselves highly available. A good example is Amazon S3 which has nine nine's availability or is 99.999999999% reliable.
* Security is improved by consolidating to a centralized security model where there is a shared security partnership with the cloud vendor. They take care of portions of security such as access to the physical data center.
* The speed applications can be developed and tested are dramatically improved. With concepts like IAC (Infrastructure as Code), complete replicas of a production environment can be provisioned, tested, and then destroyed. This leads to increased quality of software and speed in which software can be developed.

#### Cons:

* Risk of creating systems that rely on a specific cloud vendor.
* The cost involved in migrating an application to a different architecture.
* A current organization may need to hire a new workforce trained to use the cloud or retrain their workforce.

### What is Fault-Tolerance?

**Fault Tolerance** - the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of one or more of its components.

* An example is a typical car, which is designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured or damaged.
* In computer systems, a fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails.
