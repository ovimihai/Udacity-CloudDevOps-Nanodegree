# CloudFormation

---

In this hands-on exercise, you will create an S3 bucket with AWS CloudFormation.

1. Prerequisites: AWS account
2. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
  * Create a CloudFormation stack using the CloudFormation Designer
  * Launch S3 bucket using Infrastructure as Code
  * Save and deploy a CloudFormation stack
  * View resources created through CloudFormation

Follow the exercise instructions described below:

## Steps:

1. **Create CloudFormation Stack**
  * On the AWS Management Console page, type `cloud formation` in the `Find Services` box and then select `CloudFormation`.
> 
> **Important:** The redesigned AWS CloudFormation console is available now. This tutorial covers the new designer. To access the new designer, click on the `Try it out now and provide us feedback.` message that displays in a message similar to what's shown below.

CloudFormation dashboard

* If the left-hand menu options do not appear, expand the options by clicking on  in the top left-hand corner.
* Select `Designer` from the left-hand menu.
* Locate `S3` in the `Resource Type` section and expand it.
* Select Bucket and drag it to the designer window on the right-hand side.
* Copy the JSON below and replace entirely the JSON found in the `Properties` tab.
    
    { "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09", "Description": "Basic S3 Bucket CloudFormation template", "Resources": { "S3BucketCreatedByCloudFormation": { "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket", "DeletionPolicy": "Delete", "Properties": { "AccessControl": "PublicRead" } } }, "Outputs": { "BucketName": { "Value": { "Ref": "S3BucketCreatedByCloudFormation" }, "Description": "Name of the newly created Amazon S3 Bucket" } } } 

Hit the Refresh button in the upper right-hand corner so that the Designer is not out of date.

1. **Save CloudFormation Stack**
  * In the CloudFormation Designer Toolbar, click the Document icon , and click Save.
  * Click `Local File` and click `Save`. The JSON file will download.
  * In the AWS CloudFormation Designer toolbar, click to validate your template. You will see a message that states, `Template is valid`.

Designer toolbar - save, verify, and then deploy the stack.

1. **Deploy CloudFormation Stack**
  * In the CloudFormation Designer Toolbar, click to deploy the stack. The `Create stack` screen appears.
  * Accept the defaults and click `Next`.
  * Enter a `Stack name`. Leave `Parameters` empty. Click `Next`.
  * Leave the defaults and click `Next`.
  * Review the stack details and click `Create Stack`. The stack status will be `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`. To the current status of the stack, select the Refresh button in the upper right-hand corner. Once the stack reaches the `CREATE_COMPLETE` status, the stack has been deployed.
2. **View S3 Bucket created by CloudFormation Stack**
  * From the `Services` menu option at the top, type in `S3` and select `S3`.
  * To quickly find the bucket created by the CloudFormation Stack, click on `Date Created` in the column heading to sort by the most recent buckets created.
  * The newly created bucket appears at the top, `cfs3stack-s3bucketcreatedbycloudformation-1at0fv1v9ndc1`.
3. **Delete CloudFormation Stack**
  * To avoid on-going charges, delete the stack by navigating to the stack, and click the `Delete` button in the upper right-hand corner.
> 
> **Note:** When the stack is deleted, all resources created by the stack template will also be deleted.
