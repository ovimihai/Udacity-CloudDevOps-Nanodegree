According to AWS:
> 
> [Virtual private cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) (VPC) is an isolated virtual-network dedicated to your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

When you create your first instance, a default VPC is gets created for you. Alternatively, you can create your custom VPC with user-defined subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and many other desirable configurations. To get started, let's have a walkthrough of the VPC Dashboard.

## A. Get Started

Log in to your AWS account, and go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). Select the VPC service.

Snapshot 1\. Select the VPC service from the AWS Management Console

## B. VPC Dashboard

The snapshot below shows the VPC Dashboard. It shows metrics and information about all of the VPCs running in your account. You can also launch the **VPC Wizard** which will help your build your custom VPC.

Snapshot 2\. VPC Dashboard

The details of the items highlighted in red above are:

### 1\. Resource Summary

It shows the summary of VPC resources available under your account for each region. It includes VPC resources like subnets, route tables, internet gateways, endpoints, network ACL, and many more.

### 2\. Services under VPC

In the navigation on your left, you can see a categorized list of services that become a part of a VPC. Let's have an overview of a few key concepts:

* **Your VPCs** - It will list all your VPCs and display the deep-dive details of the selected VPC. Each VPC has a valid IPv4/IPv6 CIDR block allocated to it. Every resource in the VPC will have an IP address from the allocated CIDR block. Though, a few IP addresses reserved for special purposes.

* **Subnets** - It represents a subset of your VPC, i.e., a range of IP addresses from the CIDR block allocated to your VPC. Subnets of a VPC can be present in different AZs.

* **Route tables** - These are the set of rules, called routes, that determine to which IP address the network traffic should be directed.

* **Internet gateways** - If any of your resources within your VPC wants to communicate to the internet, then you must attach an internet gateway to your VPC. The internet gateway enables the communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.

### 3\. Service Health

Here, you can glance at the current status and details about the services in your VPC.

## Launch the VPC Wizard

Let's learn how to create your custom VPC. From the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home), click the **Launch VPC Wizard**. It is a two-step process, as mentioned below.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fb7f47e_screenshot-2020-11-20-at-10.17.40-pm/screenshot-2020-11-20-at-10.17.40-pm.png)

Snapshot 1\. Launch the **VPC Wizard**, and select one of the pre-defined network structure.

#### Step 1: Network Structure

Select the [Network Structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_wizard.html) from the options below:

* VPC with a Single Public Subnet
* VPC with Public and Private Subnets
* VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access
* VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN Access

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fb7f460_screenshot-2020-11-20-at-10.17.54-pm/screenshot-2020-11-20-at-10.17.54-pm.png)

Snapshot 2\. Specify the VPC configuration

#### Step 2: Specify the VPC configuration

The VPC configuration includes:

* The IP address in the VPC follows a [classless inter-domain routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) (CIDR) block of IP addresses. You will have to specify the IPv4/IPv6 CIDR block to be allocated to the VPC. In the snapshot above, it uses an IPv4 `10.0.0.0/16` block, which allocates `2^(32-16) = 65,536` IP addresses. A few IP addresses are reserved, so you get `65531` IP addresses for further allocation.
* You will have to specify the range of IP address from the allocated CIDR block for each subnet. In the example above, the public subnet has been allotted the `10.0.0.0/24` range, which comprises `2^(32-24) = 256` IP addresses. But, again a few IP addresses are reserved, so you get 251 available for resources in that subnet.

* Similarly, for the private subnet in the snapshot above, you will get 251 IP addresses.

* Specify the AZ for each subnet, [NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) _or_ elastic IP allocation ID, and the service endpoints that will allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services.

If you want to look at the list and details of all your existing VPCs, you can select the **Your VPCs** menu item from the left navigation pane of **VPC Dashboard**. See a snapshot below. Here, you can perform the following actions:

1. View the complete list of your VPCs
2. View the details of a selected VPC
3. [Create an empty VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html#Create-VPC)
4. Delete a VPC

Snapshot: **Your VPCs**, and **Details** of the selected VPC.

The details of the items highlighted in red in the snapshot above are:

## 1\. List of VPCs

For each VPC in the list, view the VPC ID, state, allocated IPv4/IPv6 CIDR block, DHCP options, route table ID, [network ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html), whether it is a default VPC, and the owner ID of the VPC.

## 2\. Details of the Selected VPC

Select the checkbox against anyone VPC to view further details. In the snapshot above, we have selected the `vpc-dab96eb1 / Udacity_Demo_VPC` VPC. You can view the details in the following tabs:

* **Details tab** - It shows the same set of information as you could view in the list of all VPCs above.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fb802ae_screenshot-2020-11-20-at-11.18.38-pm/screenshot-2020-11-20-at-11.18.38-pm.png)

Snapshot: CIDRs of the selected VPC

* **CIDRs tab** - It shows the allocated IPv4 CIDR block. The range of IPv4 addresses for your VPC in CIDR block format, for example, 10.0.0.0/16\. According to AWS, the block sizes must be between a /16 netmask and /28 netmask.

It will also show the associated IPv6 CIDR blocks, if any. AWS provides a fixed size (/56) IPv6 CIDR block. AWS doesn't allow choosing the range of IPv6 addresses for the CIDR block.

Snapshot: Flow logs of the selected VPC

* **Flow logs tab**- The flow logs allow you to capture details about the IP traffic going to/from the network interfaces in your VPC.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fb8027e_screenshot-2020-11-20-at-11.22.35-pm/screenshot-2020-11-20-at-11.22.35-pm.png)

Snapshot: Tags of the selected VPC

* **Tags tab** - They are the labels in the key-value format. In the snapshot above, it shows the `{Name: Udacity_Demo_VPC}` tag.

___

**Definition** - A [network access control list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html) (ACL) defines the set of firewall rules for controlling traffic coming in and out of subnets in your VPC.

You can view the **Network ACLs** under the **Security** section in the left navigation pane of the VPC Dashboard. See a snapshot below:

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fbce14b_screenshot-2020-11-24-at-4.00.38-pm/screenshot-2020-11-24-at-4.00.38-pm.png)

Snaphot: VPC Dashboard â†’ Network ACLs

The details of the items highlighted in red in the snapshot above are:

## 1\. List of Network ACLs

For each Network ACL in the list, view the ID, the count of associated subnets, whether it is a _Default_, the VPC Id to whom the network ACL is associated, and the owner ID.

## 2\. Details of the Selected Network ACL

View the details of the selected Network ACL. In the snapshot above, it shows the details of a default Network ACL. Note that each VPC automatically gets associated with a _modifiable default_ network ACL. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with any _one_ network ACL. Whereas, a given network ACL can be associated with multiple subnets.

### Inbound/Outbound Rules

* The default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic, as shown in the snapshot above. However, you can create or edit the rules, anytime.

* Inbound/Outbound rules are numbered and ordered. The lowest numbered rule is evaluated first. In other words, the incoming/outgoing traffic to/from a given subnet follows the _rules_ mentioned in the associated network ACL.

* Network ACLs are stateless in nature. Assume an inbound request arrived in your subnet. A "response" to the inbound request can only be sent out of the subnet if the outbound rules allow the outgoing traffic to the desired destination. A vice-versa scenario is also possible.
