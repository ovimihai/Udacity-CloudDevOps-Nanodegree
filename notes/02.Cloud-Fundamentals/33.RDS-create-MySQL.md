According to AWS:
> 
> [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) is a relational database service that manages common database administration tasks, resizes automatically, and is cost-friendly.

Let's see how to create a MySQL database, and view the details of an existing database.

## A. RDS Dashboard

Navigate to the [RDS dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home). It shows the database-resources summary, such as the count of database instances, the health of the database service, reserved instances, snapshots. You can also view the portion of the allocated storage. You can launch the **Create database** wizard from here.

## B. Create a Database

AWS provides two options to choose from:

1. **Standard create** - You have set all of the configuration options, including ones for availability, security, backups, and maintenance.

1. **Easy create** - You use the industry best-practice configurations. All configuration options, except the Encryption and VPC details, can be changed after the database is created.

The snapshot below shows the fields you choose while creating a MySQL database using the **Easy create** option.

Snapshot: Create a database - Use the RDS Free Tier template.

> Use either the **RDS Free Tier** or **Dev/test **template. On free-tier resources, you can develop and test applications to gain hands-on experience with Amazon RDS

Snapshot: Create a database - View default settings

> Notice that all configuration settings, except the Encryption and VPC details, can be changed after the database is created.

## C. Details of an Existing Database

We have created a sample `database-1` to explain the information you can view at the Databases dashboard.

Snapshot: A sample `database-1`.

> For each database in the list above, you can see the Region and availability zone it's running in, the size, and the status that it's up and running. You can also see the percentage utilization of the underlying CPU.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fbe8cb4_screenshot-2020-11-25-at-10.23.25-pm/screenshot-2020-11-25-at-10.23.25-pm.png)

Snapshot: _Connectivity & security_ details of the selected database

1. _Connectivity & security_ - View the _endpoint URL_ in the snapshot above. In order to see the data stored in this database, because it's MySQL, you can use a tool like MySQL Workbench. You will need to know the endpoint URL in order to connect directly to this database. In addition, you can view information about networking, the security groups that it's a part of, and replication information.

1. _Monitoring_ - It shows several useful metrics about the status of your database, such as CPU utilization percentage, the number of connections, the free storage space, etc.

1. _Logs & events_ - It shows useful events. For example, it shows the timestamp when the database was created, when the last backup occurred, etc.

1. _Configuration_ - It shows more high-level information, like the ARN number, DB instance configurations, MySQL engine version, creation time, the master username, and other similar details.

1. _Maintenance & backups_ - It shows any snapshots recently created. Note that the snapshots are taken automatically but you do have the option to configure it.

## More to Explore

For enterprise-level database requirements, AWS offers another service - Amazon Aurora. It is a MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible enterprise-class database, According to AWS:
> 
> [Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) supports up to 64TB of auto-scaling storage capacity, 6-way replication across three availability zones, and 15 low-latency read replicas.

# LAB: Relational Database Service (RDS)

---

In this hands-on exercise, you will create a MySQL database instance using RDS.

1. Prerequisites: AWS Account
2. By the end of this lab, you will be able to launch a MySQL database

Follow the exercise instructions described below:

### Step 1\. Launch MySQL Database

* From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) page, select the RDS service.
* From the left-hand navigation pane of the RDS dashboard, select **Databases** service, and start the **Create database** wizard.
* Choose the **Standard create** option, and use the following configuration details:

SectionFieldValue

Engine optionsEngine type`MySQL`

Engine edition`MySQL Community`

VersionDefault

TemplatesFree tier

SettingsDB instance identifierYour choice

Master Username/PasswordYour choice

DB instance sizeDB instance classBurstable classes `db.t2.micro`

StorageStorage typeGeneral purpose SSD

Allocated storage20GiB

Storage autoscalingNo

ConnectivityVirtual private cloudPrefer the default. Else, create a new VPC

Subnet groupUse default

Public accessYes

VPC security groupDefault

Availability zoneDefault

### Step 2\. View Instance Details

* You will be automatically navigated back to the **Databases** dashboard, where you can see your recently created database. Make sure the **Status** shows **Available**.
* Click on the DB identifier to review the configuration details. Scroll through, and observe how the instance is configured.

### Step 3\. Connect to the Database Instance from a MySQL Client

Once you create a database instance, you can use any MySQL client application or utility to connect to the database instance. Let's try connecting to using the _MySQL Workbench_ client. Please make sure the database you have created is public so that you can connect to it from your local computer.

1. [Download and install the MySQL Workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) on your local computer.

1. Copy the RDS database instance's endpoint URL and port number.

Copy the database instance's endpoint and port number

1. Right-click and open the installed MySQL Workbench application.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe1f0ee_screenshot-2020-12-22-at-6.06.24-pm/screenshot-2020-12-22-at-6.06.24-pm.png)

Welcome page of MySQL Workbench. Open _MySQL Connections_.

1. Paste the database instance's endpoint URL, port number, and the master username/password.

Paste the database instance's endpoint URL and port number in the MySQL Workbench

1. Test your connection. In case of an unsuccessful connection, verify the inbound rules in the security group attached to the database instance should allow incoming traffic from your local computer or anywhere on the internet.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe1f29c_screenshot-2020-12-22-at-6.15.52-pm/screenshot-2020-12-22-at-6.15.52-pm.png)

A successful connection prompt

An unsuccessful connection. Check the security group for inbound rules.

Details of the security group attached to the database instance, showing inbound traffic is allowed from anywhere on the internet.

### Step 4\. Delete Database Instance

Clean up the resources to avoid recurring charges.

* Select your newly created database from the **Databases** dashboard
* From the **Actions** button on the top-right corner, first **Stop**, and then **Delete** your database instance. You need not create a final snapshot or retain automated backups.
* Verify that you do not have a snapshot or retained automated backup.

> Would be deleting the database also delete the newly created VPC? Check it out in the VPC service.
