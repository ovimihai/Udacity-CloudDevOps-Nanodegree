# Messaging in the Cloud

There are often times that users of your applications need to be notified when certain events happen. Notifications, such as text messages or emails can be sent through services in the cloud. The use of the cloud offers benefits like lowered costs, increased storage, and flexibility.

# Simple Notification ServiceAmazon Simple Notification Service (or SNS) is a cloud service that allows you to send notifications to the users of your applications. SNS allows you to decouple the notification logic from being embedded in your applications and allows notifications to be published to a large number of subscribers.

## Features

* SNS uses a publish/subscribe model.
* SNS can publish messages to Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.

## Tips

* SNS is found under the Application Integration section on the AWS Management Console.
* SNS Topic names are limited to 256 characters.
* A notification can contain only one message.

# Queues

A queue is a data structure that holds requests called messages. Messages in a queue are commonly processed in order, first in, first out (or FIFO).

Messaging queues improve:

* performance
* scalability
* user experience

# Simple Queue ServiceAmazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to integrate queuing functionality in your application. SQS offers two types of message queues: standard and FIFO.

## Features

* send messages
* store messages
* receive messages

## Tips

* The Simple Queue Service (SQS) is found under the Application Integration on the AWS Management Console.
* FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second.
* FIFO queues guarantee the ordering of messages.
* Standard queues offer best-effort ordering but no guarantees.
* Standard queues deliver a message at least once, but occasionally more than one copy of a message is delivered.

_We will be going more in-depth on the topic of microservices in Course: Microservices at Scale using AWS & Kubernetes_

Let's learn about a few key terms:

### What is a Container?

OS level virtualization allows us to run _multiple isolated processes_ in parallel. A container is an isolated process that consists of the following items, all bundled into one package:

* the application code,
* the required dependencies (e.g. libraries, utilities, configuration files), and
* the necessary runtime environment to run the application.

Each container is an independent component that can run on its own and be moved from environment to environment.

### Benefit of Containers

* Containers make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and run applications on different hardware and platforms, quickly and easily.
* Containers share a single kernel and share application libraries.
* Containers cause a lower system overhead as compared to Virtual Machines.

### How to create containers?

Several platforms (called Container runtime/engines) allow us to create containers. A few such platforms are:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime)
* [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)
* [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/)
* [Containerd](https://containerd.io/)

In this ND, you will learn to create containers using the Docker engine.

#### Docker Containers versus Virtual Machines

There are several benefits of using Containers over VMs:

* Size: Containers are much smaller than Virtual Machines (VM) and run as isolated processes versus virtualized hardware. VMs can be in GBs while containers are in MBs.
* Speed: Virtual Machines can be slow to boot and take minutes to launch. A container can spawn much more quickly typically in seconds.
* Composability: Containers are designed to be programmatically built and are defined as source code. Virtual Machines are often replicas of a conventional computer system.

Comparing traditional, VMs, and containerized deployment

### 2\. Docker

Docker is a (container runtime) tool that helps to build, test, and run containers. You can build containers locally using a _command-line utility_, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). If there are multiple containers running individual services of an application, you will need to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) utility to specify dependent relationships between containers.

### 3\. Docker Image

An _image_ (or Docker image) is a portable auto-generated template that contains a set of instructions to create a container. An image can be instantiated multiple numbers of times to create multiple _containers_.

### 4\. Dockerfile

A text file containing commands to create an image. In other words, Docker generates images by reading the commands from a Dockerfile.

### What is Elastic Container Service (ECS)?

ECS is an orchestration service used for automating deployment, scaling, and managing of your containerized applications. ECS works well with Docker containers by:

* launching and stopping Docker containers
* scaling your applications
* querying the state of your applications

### Tips

* ECS falls under the Compute section on the AWS Management Console.
* You can schedule long-running applications, services, and batch processeses using ECS.
* Docker is the only container-runtime platform supported by Amazon ECS. Other container-runtime tools available in the insdustry are Rocket, LXD, OpenVZ, any a few more.
