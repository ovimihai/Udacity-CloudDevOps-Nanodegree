> The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands in your terminal/command prompt.

AWS CLI enables you to run commands to provision, configure, list, delete resources in the AWS cloud. Before you run any of the [aws commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/), you need to follow three steps:

1. Install AWS CLI
2. Create an IAM user with Administrator permissions
3. Configure the AWS CLI

### Step 1\. Install AWS CLI v2

Refer to the official [AWS instructions to install/update AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) (version 2) based on your underlying OS. You can verify the installation using the following command in your terminal (macOS)/cmd (Windows).
    
    # Display the folder that contains the symlink to the aws cli tool which aws # See the current version aws --version 

See the sample output below. Note that the exact version of AWS CLI and Python may vary in your system.

Mac/Linux/Windows: Verify the successful installation of AWS CLI 2

### Step 2\. Create an IAM user

In this step, you will create an IAM user with Administrator permissions who is allowed to perform _any_ action in your AWS account, only through CLI. After creating such an IAM user, we will use its **Access key **(long-term credentials)to configure the AWS CLI locally.

Let's create an [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html) user, and copy its Access key.

> AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service allows you to authorize users / applications (such as AWS CLI) to access AWS resources.

The Access key is a combination of an **Access Key ID** and a **Secret Access Key. **Let's see the steps to create an IAM user, and generate its Access key.

* Navigate to the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home), and create an IAM user.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/6012c726_screenshot-2021-01-28-at-7.12.20-pm/screenshot-2021-01-28-at-7.12.20-pm.png)

Add a new IAM user

* Set the user details, such as the name, and access type as _Programmatic access_ only.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/6012cbf9_screenshot-2021-01-28-at-7.13.05-pm/screenshot-2021-01-28-at-7.13.05-pm.png)

Set the user name, and type (mode) of access

* Set the permissions to the new user by attaching the AWS Managed **AdministratorAccess** policy from the list of existing policies.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe30edb_screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.48.57-pm/screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.48.57-pm.png)

Attach the _AdministratorAccess_ policy from the list of pre-created policies

* Provide tags \[optional\], review the details of the new user, and finally create the new user.

* After a user is created successfully, download the access key file (.csv) containing the _Access Key ID_ and a _Secret Access Key_. You can even copy the keys and stay on the same page. **Don't skip this step as this will be your only opportunity to download the secret access key file.**

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/6012cc3d_screenshot-2021-01-28-at-7.14.44-pm/screenshot-2021-01-28-at-7.14.44-pm.png)

Copy the Access key of the new user OR download the .csv file containing the Access key

### Step 3\. Configure the AWS CLI

You will need to configure the following four items on your local machine before you can interact with any of the AWS services:

1. **Access key** - It is a combination of an _Access Key ID_ and a _Secret Access Key_. Together, they are referred to as _Access key_. You can generate an Access key from the AWS IAM service, and specify the level of permissions (authorization) with the help of _IAM Roles_.
2. **Default AWS Region** - It specifies the AWS Region where you want to send your requests by default.
3. **Default output format** - It specifies how the results are formatted. It can either be a json, yaml, text, or a table.
4. **Profile** - A collection of settings is called a profile. The default profile name is `default`, however, you can create a new profile using the `aws configure --profile new_name` command.

---

**Here are the steps to configure the AWS CLI in your terminal:**

* Run the command below to configure the AWS CLI using the _Access Key ID_ and a _Secret Access Key_ generated in the previous step. If you have closed the web console that showed the access key, you can open the downloaded access key file (.csv) to copy the keys later.
    
    aws configure 

> If you already have a profile set locally, you can use `--profile <profile-name>` option with any of the AWS commands above. This will resolve the conflict with the existing profiles set up locally.

* The command above will store the access key in a default file `~/.aws/credentials` and store the profile in the `~/.aws/config` file. Upon prompt, paste the copied access key (access key id and secret access key). Enter the default region as `us-east-1` and output format as `json`. You can verify the saved config using:
    
    # View the current configuration aws configure list # View all existing profile names aws configure list-profiles # In case, you want to change the region in a given profile # aws configure set <parameter> <value> --profile <profile-name> aws configure set region us-east-1 

* **Important** - If you have already set the **temporary** AWS Access keys generated in the classroom that expires after the session ends, you should set the `aws_session_token` to a blank string, using the command below:
    
    # Configure a single field aws configure set aws_session_token "" --profile default 

Otherwise, you may encounter _InvalidClientTokenId_ error while running AWS CLI commands.

![Mac/Linux: A successful configuration](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/November/618b94b2_screenshot-2021-11-10-at-3.11.07-pm/screenshot-2021-11-10-at-3.11.07-pm.png)

Mac/Linux: A successful configuration

* Let the system know that your sensitive information is residing in the .aws folder
    
    export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=~/.aws/config export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=~/.aws/credentials 

* **Windows users with GitBash only**  
You will have to set the environment variables. Run the following commands in your GitBash terminal:
    
    setx AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE setx AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY setx AWS_DEFAULT_REGION us-west-2 

Replace the access key ID and secret, as applicable to you. Windows users using WSL do not need this step, they will follow all steps as if they are Linux users.

Windows: Successful configuration using the GitBash terminal

### Step 4\. Run your first AWS CLI command

* Check the successful configuration of the AWS CLI, by running either of the following AWS command:
    
    # If you've just one profile set locally aws iam list-users # If you've multiple profiles set locally aws iam list-users --profile <profile-name> 

The output will display the details of the recently created user:
    
    { "Users": [ { "Path": "/", "UserName": "Admin", "UserId": "AIDAZMXYZ3LY2BNC5ZM5E", "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::388752792305:user/Admin", "CreateDate": "2021-01-28T13:44:15+00:00" } ] } 

### Troubleshoot

If you are facing issues while following the commands above, refer to the detailed instructions here -

1. [Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
2. [Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
3. [Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

### Updating the specific variable in the configuration

In the future, you can set a single value, by using the command, such as:
    
    # Syntax # aws configure set <varname> <value> [--profile profile-name] aws configure set default.region us-east-2 

It will update only the region variable in the existing default profile.

### Prerequisites:

1. An AWS account
2. AWS CLI installed on your client. If not, refer to the official [AWS instructions to install/update AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) (version 2) based on your underlying OS.
3. \[Optional\] AWS root user's access keys configured in your CLI tool

### Topics Covered:

1. Using the AWS console, create a new IAM user with Programmatic administrator access. **We will delete this user programmatically at the end of the exercise.**
2. Using the CLI tool, create a bucket, upload a file to it, and then delete the bucket
3. Using the CLI tool, delete an IAM user

## Step 1\. Create a new IAM user

Let's create a new IAM user who would be allowed to interact with services in your AWS account as an administrator. The AWS allows us to choose if the new user should be granted a _Programmatic access_, or _AWS web console access_. The permissions to a user are granted in form of **Policies**, which are JSON documents. The AWS web console provides a pre-created list of policies to choose from.

1. Navigate to the IAM console, and access the [IAM Users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) service. Start the **Add user** wizard, as shown below.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe30e71_screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.46.50-pm/screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.46.50-pm.png)

Launch the _Add user_ wizard

1. Set the user details, such as the name, and access type as _Programmatic access_ only.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe30e92_screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.47.55-pm/screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.47.55-pm.png)

Set the user name, and type (mode) of access

1. Set the permissions to the new user by attaching the AWS Managed **AdministratorAccess** policy from the list of existing policies.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe30edb_screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.48.57-pm/screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.48.57-pm.png)

Attach the _AdministratorAccess_ policy from the list of pre-created policies

1. Provide tags \[optional\], review the details of the new user, and finally create the new user.

1. Download the Access key file (.csv) that contains two items: an access key ID, and a secret. **Don't skip this step as this will be your only opportunity to download the Access key file.**

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe30f2e_screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.51.31-pm/screenshot-2020-12-23-at-12.51.31-pm.png)

After a user is created successfully, download the access key file (.csv) containing the access key ID and a secret

## Step 2\. Configure a new profile in the AWS CLI

1. Now, to allow the newly created user to interact with the AWS services via CLI, configure the access key in your CLI tool. Let's create a new profile `UdacityLab`, and associate the newly created access key to it. You can use the following commands:
    
    # Navigate back to your home folder cd # Set the UdacityLab profile credentials in the "credentials" and "config" file aws configure --profile UdacityLab 

It will prompt you to enter the following four values:
  * AWS Access Key ID - Paste the value from the downloaded access key file
  * AWS Secret Access Key - Paste the value from the downloaded access key file
  * Default region name - Enter your preferred region name, such as us-east-2
  * Default output format - It can accept either a json, yaml, text, or a table. Enter json for this exercise.
2. You can review the current configuration as:
    
    # Check the configuration aws configure list #View the content of the credentials and configuration file cat ~/.aws/credentials cat ~/.aws/config 

If you haven't configured any profile ever, you can set the environment variables as well.
    
    # Let the system know that your sensitive information is residing in the .aws folder export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=~/.aws/config export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=~/.aws/credentials 

> **Note** - You can create multiple profiles, and use a specific one in any aws command using the `--profile <profile-name>` option.

## Step 3\. Interact with S3 service

1. Create a public bucket with name `my-033212455158-bucket` in the us-east-1 region, using the newly created `UdacityLab` profile.
    
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-033212455158-bucket --acl public-read-write --region us-east-1 --profile UdacityLab 

In the command above,
  * `--bucket` option specifies the bucket name of your choice. It must be unique across all AWS accounts.
  * `--profile` option specifies the profile whose credentials will be verified for authorization before accessing the S3 service. This option is OPTIONAL. If skipped, the aws CLI will use the default profile stored in your system.
  * `--acl` option specifies the accessibility level
  * `--region` specifies the AWS region where you want to create this bucket

Reference - [aws s3api create-bucket command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html)

1. Upload a file to your bucket. The command below uploads a file names `Sample.html`, however, you can choose any file from your local system.
    
    aws s3api put-object --bucket my-033212455158-bucket --key Sample.html --body Sample.html --profile UdacityLab 

In the command above,
  * `--key` option specifies the name you want to assign to your object in the bucket
  * `--body` option specifies the file name (complete path) to upload from your local system

Reference [aws s3api put-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html)

1. Verify the S3 bucket by going to the AWS web console.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/December/5fe31786_screenshot-2020-12-23-at-1.40.20-pm/screenshot-2020-12-23-at-1.40.20-pm.png)

A public bucket created using the CLI

1. Delete the bucket and its content. A bucket can only be deleted if it is empty. Therefore, first delete the `Sample.html`, and then delete the bucket, as follows:
    
    aws s3api delete-object --bucket my-033212455158-bucket --key Sample.html aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket my-033212455158-bucket --profile UdacityLab 

**Reference** - [aws s3api commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html#available-commands)

1. Navigate back to the S3 dashboard (AWS web console), and verify if the bucket has been deleted successfully.

## Step 4\. \[Optional\] Delete the newly created `UdacityLab` IAM user

Remember, you created the `UdacityLab` IAM user using the AWS web console. However, you can delete the newly created `UdacityLab` IAM user from your CLI tool as well.
> 
> **Note** - We are assuming that your AWS **root user access key** is set in the `default` profile using the command `aws configure --profile default`. Use the `cat ~/.aws/credentials` command to list all the credentials set locally.

1. View the list of all users (other than the root user) in your AWS account.
    
    aws iam list-users 

1. A user can only be deleted only after deleting the attached user policies, and access key. The commands below are executed using the `default` profile, therefore we have not used the `--profile` option.
    
    # List the policies attached to the UdacityLab user aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name UdacityLab # A policy can be detached using its ARN, a unique identifier aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name UdacityLab --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess # List the access key for UdacityLab user aws iam list-access-keys --user-name UdacityLab # An access key can be deleted using its access key id aws iam delete-access-key --user-name UdacityLab --access-key-id AKIAQGW4TBMDIZQP564S # Delete the user aws iam delete-user --user-name UdacityLab 

**Reference** - [aws iam commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/index.html#available-commands)

1. Navigate back to the IAM console, and access the [IAM Users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) service to verify if the user has been successfully deleted.
