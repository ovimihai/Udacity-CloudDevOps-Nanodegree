### How does Amazon ECS helps?

Assume you have a multi-container application that you want to run on the cloud. You may also require to scale the containers automatically based on the incoming traffic in such a case.

Amazon ECS deploys, manages, and scales containers based on your resource needs and supports other AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing, EC2 security groups, EBS volumes, and IAM roles.

### Key terms related to Amazon ECS

1. **Task definition**  
A [task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size) describes the application requirements concerning containers, such as the max amount of total CPU and memory used for the task (not for the individual container) and container definitions.

ECS offers to create a task definition using either the AWS Fargate or AWS EC2\. AWS Fargate is priced based on the task size, whereas the EC2 service is priced based on computing resource usage.

You can create a task definition using either the AWS Fargate or AWS EC2

Either way, you can add a container definition, as shown in the snapshot below.

Add a container definition

1. **ECS cluster**  
A [cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html) is a set of containers running task requests within an AWS region. A default cluster gets created when you create and run your first task definition.

1. **Container agent**  
It is a utility that connects container instances to one of your clusters. Each container instance runs a container agent.

1. **Container instance**  
A [container instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_instances.html) is an EC2 instance that is registered into any of your ECS clusters.

Choosing the **Networking only** template, that allows creating a cluster and optionally create a VPC, and subnets.

1. At the _Configure Cluster_ step, enter the name for your cluster. Choose a unique name.

1. In the _Networking_ section, create a new VPC for your cluster. You can keep the default settings for the subnet division.

Creating the cluster in a new VPC

1. Enable the CloudWatch container insights. And finally, click the Create button.

_Congratulations, you've created your first Cluster_
