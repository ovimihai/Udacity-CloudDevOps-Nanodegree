In the previous lab, you learned to create a _custom policy_ that can allow users to access a specific set of services with defined permissions. Let's learn to attach the _custom policy_ to a new user.

### Prerequisites:

1. An AWS account
2. A sample IAM policy should be present in your account

### Topics Covered:

1. Using the AWS console, create a new IAM user with custom permissions
2. Change the mode of access and attach another policy to an existing user

### Step 1\. Create a new IAM user

Let's create a new IAM user who would be allowed to interact with services in your AWS account as an administrator. The AWS allows us to choose if the new user should be granted a _Programmatic access_, or _AWS web console access_. The permissions to a user are granted in form of **Policies**, which are JSON documents. The AWS web console provides a pre-created list of policies to choose from.

1. Navigate to the IAM console, and access the [IAM Users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) service. Start the **Add user** wizard, as shown below.

Launch the _Add user_ wizard

1. Set the user details, such as the name, and access type as _Programmatic access_ only.

Set the user name, and type (mode) of access. For this exercise, select the programmatic access. However, you can experiment with the console access as well.

1. Set the permissions to the new user by _attaching the newly created_ policy. Though, the AWS provides three ways to grant permissions:
  * Add the user to an existing group that has a defined set of permissions
  * Copy the permissions from an existing user
  * Attach any existing policies to the new user. AWS provides and manages a set of pre-defined standard policies.

Attach the newly custom policy to the new user

1. Provide tags \[optional\], review the details of the new user, and finally create the new user.

1. Download the Access key file (.csv) that contains two items: an access key ID, and a secret. We need this file while trying to access the AWS services from the command-line tool**.**

After a user is created successfully, download the access key file (.csv) containing the access key ID and a secret. In the upcoming lesson, we will learn to configure the command-line tool (AWS CLI) with these credentials.

### Step 2\. Review the new user

1. Navigate back to the IAM Users dashboard, select the newly created user to view its details.

Select the new user to view its details

1. View the details of the newly created user. Particularly, check the _Permissions_, _Security credentials_, and _Access Advisor_ tabs to see the list of services that this user can access.

Summary of the newly created user

### Step 3\. Change the mode of access and attach another policy

In the previous steps, we attached a policy while creating a new user. However, you can attach/detach a policy even after a user is created. Let's try to do the following to the current user:

1. **Enable the AWS web console access**
  * Go to the _Security credentials_ tab, and click on _Manage_ the console password.

Manage the console access

* Enable the console access, and save the login credentials.

Enable the console access

Save the new user's login credentials. The .csv file will contain three items: User name, Password, and Console login link

1. **Attach the _AmazonRDSFullAccess_ AWS managed policy**
  * Go back to the _Permissions_ tab, and select _Add permissions_.

Add new permissions to an existing user

* Attach the _AmazonRDSFullAccess_ AWS managed policy that will provide full access to AWS RDS service via the AWS web console.

Attach _AmazonRDSFullAccess_ policy to the current user

* Review and add the permissions

* Check the _Access Advisor_ tab again to review the new policies attached to the current user.

### Step 4\. Log in to AWS management console as an IAM user

Recall that you have saved the new user's login credentials (.csv file) containing three items: User name, Password, and Console login link.

1. Using an incognito browser, go to the console login link provided to you, or go to the standard [AWS console sign-in page](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Provide the Account ID, IAN user name, and password.

Log in as an IAM user

1. Verify that you are logged in as a new IAM user.

Logged in as an IAM user

1. Once the exercise is complete, do not forget to **delete the custom policy and the new user** you created in the steps above. You would have to logout as an IAM user and then log back into the AWS web console as a root user to do so. Once you are in the IAM service dashboard, the ideal order of deletion would be:
  * Detach the policy from the IAM user
  * Delete the IAM user
  * Delete the IAM policy
