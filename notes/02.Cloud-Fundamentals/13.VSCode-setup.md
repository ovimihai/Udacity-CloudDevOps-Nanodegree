## Connect the VS Code to AWS Account

There is a plug-in, **AWS Toolkit**, available for the Visual Studio Code using which you can create/configure/delete any AWS resource.

### 1\. Install AWS Toolkit in VS Code

* Start your VS code editor, and switch to the **Extensions** tab.
* Search and install the **AWS Toolkit** plug-in, as shown in the snapshot below.

Install AWS Toolkit Extension

* Once the plug-in is installed, you will see the AWS icon in the tool bar, and a starter tutorial on how to connect to AWS. We have explained the steps below as well.

### 2\. Provide Access Key

The steps below will create `config` and `credentials` files automatically, that will store the AWS credentials (Access Key) and some default configurations (such as region).

1. Open the **Command Palette** in the VS Code editor. To do so, either choose on the Menu bar → View → Command Palette or use the following shortcut keys:
  * Windows and Linux: **Ctrl+Shift+P**
  * macOS: **Command+Shift+P**
2. Search for AWS and choose **AWS: Create Credentials Profile**. Note that this option can also be used for updating the existing profile. If you already have any profile set already, then the `config` and `credentials` files will open up for editing, as shown below.

![The `config` and `credentials` files opened up for editing](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/September/61419dc0_screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.38-pm/screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.38-pm.png)

The `config` and `credentials` files opened up for editing. Notice the `[default]` profile only.

1. Provide a profile name of your choice or choose `default`, along with **access key ID, secret access key**, and the **session token**, as highlighted in the snapshot above.

You can copy the value of access key ID, secret access key, and the session token from the pop up that come after clicking on the **"OPEN AWS GATEWAY"** link in the left navigation pane of the classroom. You will have to copy-paste the following values:
    
    # credentials file showing a Default profile [default] aws_access_key_id=***** aws_secret_access_key=******* aws_session_token=*********************** # config file [default] region = us-east-1 output = json 

Note that a profile is analogous to a single AWS account. If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can create mutiple profiles locally.
> 
> **Note** Classroom generated access key ID, secret access key, and the session token are valid only for the current session duration - 4 hours. **You will have to refresh the classroom page, regenerate the Access Key again, and save them again in the VScode.**

Access key that pops up after clicking on the **"OPEN AWS GATEWAY"** link in the left navigation pane.

1. Later in this program, if you generate **permanent** Access key (id and secret) using AWS IAM service, you can save them in the VSCode the same way explained above, and delete the `aws_session_token`, as shown in the snapshot below. Otherwise, you may encounter `InvalidClientTokenId` error while running AWS CLI commands.

Delete the `aws_session_token` when you are using the **permanent** Access key

### 3\. Connect to AWS

* Open the **Command Palette** in the VS Code editor.
* Search for AWS and choose **AWS: Connect to AWS**
* Choose a profile you have created in the step above.
* On a successful connection, **AWS: profile:XXXXXX** will appear at the bottom left of VS Code window.
