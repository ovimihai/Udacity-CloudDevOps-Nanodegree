Filter the newly created policy

1. Click on the name of your policy.
2. Review the JSON for the policy you just created on the `Permissions` tab.
3. Click on the `Policy usage` tab to see if this policy is in use. Notice that this policy is not attached to any resources yet.

A sample JSON file constituting the policy. Now, you can **attach** this policy to any user or other AWS service.

1. Each resource in the AWS gets a unique identifier, ARN. The newly created policy will also get its ARN, such as, `arn:aws:iam::014421265158:policy/myFirstPolicy` shown in the snapshot above.
