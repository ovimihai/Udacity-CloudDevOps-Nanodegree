## Launch the AWS Web Console in your Udacity Classroom

You are given a _federated user account_, a temporary AWS user account with limited permissions, that you can use in this course.

To log in to an AWS console, click the **button in the left navigation** labeled **"Open AWS Gateway"** and then **"Open AWS Console."** This will open the AWS console in a new browser tab. This may take a few moments to load the first time.

## Important Points to Remember

#### **1\. Session limit**

Note that there is a **session time limit**. If reached, you will automatically be timed out. As long as you have not used your entire budget, your work will be saved. You can re-launch using the same "Open AWS Gateway" button in the left navigation menu to return to your session.

#### **2\. Default AWS region**

The default AWS region for you will be US East (N. Virginia) (_us-east-1_). However, you can switch and practice in select few other regions as well.

#### **3\. Budget allocated for you**

All AWS services are a pay-as-you-go service. Udacity has set a budget for each student to complete their course work. Please understand that these credits are limited and available for you to use judiciously. The budget for this entire Nanodegree is $75 for you. Although, we find about $20 sufficient for most to complete this Nanodegree.

#### 4\. Shut down your resources | No extra credits

We recommend you **shut down/delete every AWS resource** (e.g., EC2, Sagemaker, RDS, Redshift, EMR, CloudFormation, EKS) immediately after the usage or if you are stepping away for a few hours. Otherwise, you will run out of your allocated budget of $75\. Udacity will not provide additional credits. In case you exhaust your credits:

* **You will lose your progress on the AWS console.**
* **You will have to use your personal AWS account to finish the remaining ND.** Even if you are in the middle of the project/exercise and need to step away, you must shut down your resources. You can re-instantiate them later. To better understand pricing, see the [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for all available services.
> 
> For reference, any service available to you @$0.1/hour or higher should be monitored closely and shut down immediately after use or if you are stepping away.

#### **5\. Tracking your usage**

You need to make sure that you have an adequate budget available to complete your project/task. If you hit your budget, your session will time out and your work will be lost and unrecoverable. Options for you to stay vigilant are:

* Track your usage on the AWS web console. Go to [AWS Billing Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/), and view the monthly spending. It will list you the services constituting the spend.
* Submit a [ticket](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=110806) to Student Support Services to know your current balance.

> **Note** -  
> As you are given a temporary AWS user account with **limited** permissions, you might not be able to avail **all** AWS services. We have allowed the necessary ones only. If you see a few warning messages related to insufficient permissions, you can ignore them and proceed with your practice.
