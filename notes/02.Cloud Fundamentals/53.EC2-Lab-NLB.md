In this hands-on exercise, you will learn to create a [network load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) (NLB), and see the role of an NLB.
> 
> An NLB serves as the single point of contact for clients and automatically distributes the incoming traffic uniformly across multiple targets. The targets are the EC2 instances within the same or different AZs.

### Prerequisites:

* An AWS account
* A default VPC. It is a VPC in a default region and has a public subnet in each Availability Zone. Refer to the [create a default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#create-default-vpc) for more details. Just to ensure you have the right set of VPC, subnet, route table, and internet gateway available, refer to the snapshots below.

**Prerequisite 3:** A route table with a rule for internet facing communication. See that it requires an internet gateway

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/60057a01_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-5.27.07-pm/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-5.27.07-pm.png)

**Prerequisite 4:** The Internet gateway is a managed service. See an internet gateway attached to the default vpc.

### Step 1\. Create the first EC2 instance

The steps below show how to create the first EC2 instance in a **public subnet** in any one Availability Zone, and install the Apache webserver on it. Use the following configuration, and leave the remaining values as the defaults.

* Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard page, and click on the **Launch Instance** wizard to launch an instance. Choose the AMI and instance type as:

StepValue

1\. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)`Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type`  
Note: You have chosen a **Free Tier Eligible** AMI

2\. Instance Type`t2.micro`

* At the next step, Configure Instance Details, use the following values:

FieldValue

Number of Instances1

NetworkSelect the default VPC that has public subnets in different AZs

SubnetChoose anyone, say `us-east-2a`

Auto-assign Public IPEnable

Let's add advanced details.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/600558b7_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-1.58.55-pm/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-1.58.55-pm.png)

A default VPC and a public subnet chosen to launch the first EC2 instance.

* Under the Advanced Details â†’ User data section, add the following configuration script to run automatically during launch.
    
    #!/bin/bash sudo yum update -y sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2 sudo yum install -y httpd mariadb-server sudo systemctl start httpd sudo systemctl enable httpd sudo chkconfig httpd on # Set file permissions for the Apache web server sudo groupadd www sudo usermod -a -G www ec2-user sudo chgrp -R www /var/www sudo chmod 2775 /var/www find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} + find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} + # Create a new PHP file at /var/www/html/ path echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php 

The script above will install, configure, and launch the Apache webserver on the EC2 instance. You can learn more about the individual steps at [Create an EC2 instance and install a web server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateWebServer.html#CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateWebServer.Apache).

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/6005593c_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-2.55.33-pm/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-2.55.33-pm.png)

Specify the user data to configure the EC2 instance

* Keep the storage as default, and use a tag as `Name: Server-A`

* At the Configure Security Group step, you can create a new one, and ensure to have a firewall rule to allow incoming HTTP traffic on port 80\.

TypeProtocolPortSource

HTTPTCP80`0.0.0.0/0`  
It will allow all IPv4  
addresses to access your instance.

SSHTCP22`0.0.0.0/0`

The step above is crucial for the current experiment.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/60055a78_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.11.31-am/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.11.31-am.png)

Configure firewall rule to allow HTTP traffic on port 80

* Generate and download a new key pair, at the last stage of the **Launch Instance** wizard.  
**_Important:_** This key-pair will allow you to log into your instance, using SSH, from your local machine. Save the key-pair carefully, because the same private key cannot be re-generated.

### Step 2\. Create the second EC2 instance, in a separate Availability Zone

Launch the second EC2 instance using the same steps above, except for the following changes at the Configure Instance Details step:

* Select another **public subnet** in a different AZ, say `us-east-2b`
* Replace the last line of the user data (shell script) with
    
    echo "<? echo "<h1>Welcome to server 2</h1>" ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php 

Additionally, change the tag to `Name: Server-B`.

### Step 3\. Verify the Apache webserver installation

* Confirm that the newly created EC2 instances are in the `running` state.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/60055d08_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.26.31-am/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.26.31-am.png)

Two instances running in different AZs. **Server-A** is running in **us-east-2a**, while **Server-B** is running in **us-east-2b**.

* Verify that the Apache server is running successfully on both the EC2 instances. Simply copy, and paste the **public IPv4 address** of each instance in a new browser window. If the Apache is configured successfully, you will see the Apache welcome page.
> 
> **Note**: We have opened the HTTP traffic on the default port, therefore the public IPv4 address should be prepended with `http://`, instead of `https://`.

* [Configuring the secure HTTPS on EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-2.html) will add overhead to the current experiment, and you may deviate from the intent of learning an NLB.
> 
> **Need help?**: Refer to the [How do I troubleshoot an unresponsive website hosted on my EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-instance-hosting-unresponsive-website/) or clean restart the exercise by deleting the VPC, and EC2 resources again.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/60055eba_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.23.42-am/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.23.42-am.png)

The image above shows the output at HTTP (not HTTPS), such as, `http://18.218.185.145` and `http://18.217.72.14`

* View the content of the PHP page that you configured using the shell script.

The image above shows the output at HTTP (not HTTPS), such as, `http://18.218.185.145/phpinfo.php` and `http://18.217.72.14/phpinfo.php`

### Step 4\. Create an NLB

* Select the **Load Balancers** service on the left-hand side menu of the EC2 dashboard, and click on the **Create Load Balancer** button.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/600563d3_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.34.03-am/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.34.03-am.png)

Click on the Create Load Balancer button

* You will be prompt to choose the type of load balancer: Application, Network, or Classical load balancer. Choose to create a **Network Balancer**.

* At the first step, Configure Load Balancer, use the following basic configuration details

**Section****Field****Value**

Basic ConfigurationName`udacity-nlb`

Scheme`internet-facing`

Availability ZonesVPCChoose default-vpc

Availability ZonesCheck the two where you've launched the EC2 instances,  
such as `us-east-2a` and `us-east-2b`

See the snapshot below:

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/600568aa_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.44.11-am/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.44.11-am.png)

Add VPC and AZs to the load balancer

* Skip the Configure Security Settings step, by clicking the Next button.

* At the Configure Routing step, use the following configuration details in the Target group section:

**Field****Value**

Target groupNew target group

Name`UdacityNLBTarget`

Target typeInstance

ProtocolTCP

Port80

* At the Register Targets step, add the two EC2 instances created previously to the target group.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/600569cc_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.50.48-am/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-11.50.48-am.png)

Add instances to the registered target group. Do not forget to click on the **Add to registered** button after selecting the instances from the list.

* Leave the remaining things as default, and finish creating the NLB.

### Step 5\. Test the NLB

* You will be taken back to the **Load Balancers** dashboard. Copy the **DNS name** of the newly created NLB, and append the `/phpinfo.php` at the end of it. A sample DNS name appended with the file name looks like this:
    
    http://udacity-nlb-f00b2cb9e62f5c2a.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/phpinfo.php 

* Paste the copied DNS name to a new browser window and refresh the browser a few times, each after a few seconds. You will notice that sometimes the request is redirected to Server-A and other times, it is routed to Server-B.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/6005734d_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-1.32.49-pm/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-1.32.49-pm.png)

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/60057322_screenshot-2021-01-18-at-1.37.12-pm/screenshot-2021-01-18-at-1.37.12-pm.png)

The NLB is getting the output from the two different webservers. Notice that the DNS name (URL) is the same in the above two cases.

### Step 6\. Delete the resources

* Delete the NLB by going to the Load Balancer dashboard.

* Stop and terminate the EC2 instances by going to the Instances dashboard.
