In this tutorial, you will learn to launch an [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (EC2) instance. An EC2 instance is a Virtual Machine (VM) with user-defined configuration that runs on the cloud. There are a plethora of options to choose the instance-configuration of your choice. Let's learn the general steps to build an instance with any given configuration.

## A. Prerequisite

1. You should have an AWS account.

## B. Go to the EC2 Dashboard

1. Log in to your AWS account, and go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). Select the EC2 service.

Snapshot: AWS Management Console. You can select any AWS service from here.

1. Have a look at the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home). The EC2 Dashboard is home to a variety of related services, such as Amazon Machine Images, Elastic Block Store (EBS), Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling.

## C. Start the Launch Instance Wizard

Launching an instance is an eight-step process, as described below. At any stage, you can refer to the instruction given in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance) for help.

### Step 1 - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

An AMI is a template used to create a VM. AMI contains the pre-installed operating system, application server, and applications required to launch your instance. There is a variety of Linux, Windows, and other OS servers available. **Choose the one available under the free-tier option.**

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fbb5c30_screenshot-2020-11-19-at-6.50.13-pm/screenshot-2020-11-19-at-6.50.13-pm.png)

Snapshot: Choose AMI. The **Quick Start** provides a list of basic AMIs.

### Step 2 - Choose an Instance Type

Instance Type offers varying combinations of CPUs, memory (GB), storage (GB), types of network performance, and availability of IPv6 support. AWS offers a variety of instance types, based on the configuration you choose. **Prefer to choose any one of those types supported by a free tier account**.

Snapshot: Choose an Instance Type.

Select the hardware configuration of your instance. The `t2.micro` instance type, which is available under the **free tier**, is selected by default. It has 1 vCPU, 2.5 GHz, 1 GiB memory, the default root volume, and supports additional EBS storage.

### Step 3 - Configure Instance Details

Provide the instance count and configuration details, such as network, subnet, behavior, monitoring, etc.

Snapshot: Configure Instance Details. The wizard will populate the default values for all fields.

### Step 4 - Add Storage

You can choose to attach either SSD or Standard Magnetic drive to your instance.

Snapshot: Add Storage. You can edit the setting of the default root volume or attach additional EBS volumes.

### Step 5 - Add Tags

A tag serves as a label that you can attach to multiple AWS resources, such as volumes, instances, users, or roles. Tagging helps in easy search and grouping resources for various purposes.

Snapshot: Add Tags. Tags help to categorize the resources across AWS services. It works as a label.

### Step 6 - Configure Security Group

Attach a set of firewall rules to your instance(s) that controls the incoming traffic to your instance(s).

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/November/5fb67951_screenshot-2020-11-19-at-7.05.19-pm/screenshot-2020-11-19-at-7.05.19-pm.png)

Snapshot: Security Groups. It defines the firewall rules, such as the protocol to open to network traffic and the set of valid IP addresses. By default, SSH protocol is used for a Linux instance, and RDP for a Windows instance. HTTP and HTTPS allow Internet traffic to reach your instance.

### Step 7 - Review

Review your instance details before the launch.

Snapshot: Review

### Step 8 - Download Key Pair

AWS generates a pair of public and private (encrypted) keys, that help in logging into the EC2 instance. Download the private key (.pem file) locally. The public key will be stored on the EC2 instance, while the private key will be available to download locally, **_just once_**. In case, if the private key file (.pem) is misplaced or lost, the AWS doesn't allow regenerating the private key.

Snapshot: EC2 dashboard â†’ Instances dashboard showing a running instance. You can select the checkbox against the instance you wish to connect/stop/terminate/view details. In this dashboard, you will see all your instances, their properties, and configuration details.

> **Note** - Do not forget to shut down/terminate every AWS resource after use. You can instantiate them again when you'd come back.

_Now, in one of your hands-on exercises next, you will have the chance to spin up your own EC2 Instance._.

# Virtual Servers in the Cloud

---

In this hands-on exercise, you will launch a virtual server in the cloud within a secure network. You will also manage additional storage options for your server.

1. Prerequisites: AWS Account
2. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
  * Launch a secure EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
  * Manage an EBS volume

## Instructions:

### Step 1\. Create a VPC

* From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) page, select the VPC service.
* Use the **Launch VPC Wizard** to create a **VPC with a Single Public Subnet**. You can use the following field-values, and leave the remaining values as the defaults:

FieldValue

`VPC name`{Your choice}

`Availability Zone`Select the first AZ from the dropdown

* Verify that you should see the newly created VPC in the **Your VPCs** service shown on the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home). Note the Name / VPC ID of the newly created VPC.

### Step 2\. Launch an EC2 instance, and attach an EBS volume

* Navigate to the EC2 console page: Click on **Services** in the upper left-hand menu, type `EC2` in the text box, and select the `EC2` service.
* On the EC2 Dashboard page, select the **Instances** services in the left-hand navigation pane.
* Use the **Launch Instance** wizard to launch an instance with the following configuration, and leave the remaining values as the defaults:

StageConfigurationValue

1\.Amazon Machine Image (AMI)`Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type`  
Note: You have chosen a **Free Tier Eligible** AMI

2\.Instance Type`t2.micro`

3\.Configure Instance Details

a. Number of Instances1

b. NetworkSelect the VPC that was created in the previous step

c. SubnetDefault

4\.Storage

a. Root volumeDefault

a. Additional volumeEBS volume  
(8GiB, General purpose SSD-gp2, deletes on termination)

5\.TagsOptional

6\.Security GroupDefault. Rule with `0.0.0.0/0` source will allow all IP  
addresses to access your instance.

* Generate and download a new key pair, at the last stage of the **Launch Instance** wizard.  
**_Important:_** This key-pair will allow you to log into your instance, using SSH, from your local machine. Save the key-pair carefully, because the same private key cannot be re-generated.
* Verify that you should see the newly created EC2 instance in the **Instances** services. Check the instance state, it should say `running`.
> 
> **Congratulations!** You've launched your first virtual server in the cloud.

### Step 3\. Cleanup & Disable EC2 Instance

To avoid recurring charges for leaving an instance running, let's disable the EC2 instance and terminate the VPC

* From the EC2 Dashboard, select the instance just created, click on the **Instance State** button on top-right, and then select **Terminate instance**.

* From the EC2 Dashboard, select the **Volumes** services on the left navigation pane, and view the list of all existing EBS volumes in your account. You must delete the volumes created during the current exercise.

* From the VPC Dashboard, select the VPC just created, click on the **Actions** button on top-right, then select **Delete VPC**.
