> Amazon SQS is a service that hosts the queue of messages (requests and responses) from the decoupled application components. Have a quick look at this [SQS workflow](https://d2yegcrkszs8ng.cloudfront.net/sqsconsole-20200912023453940/assets/images/5e3f44ce52788a4fb8b8432e4441bf3f-SQS-diagram.svg) to understand it better.

Let's see how to create an SQS queue, and learn to send/receive messages.

## A. Queues Dashboard

From the AWS management console, select SQS (Simple Queue Service), or you can directly go to the [Queues dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/v2/home). Start the **Create queue** wizard from there.

## B. Create a Queue

A queue can be created quickly in three steps:

1. _General details_ - Provide a case-sensitive name, and choose the type of queue - Standard or FIFO, you want to create. A standard queue supports an unlimited number of transactions per second (TPS) for each API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Whereas, FIFO queues support up to 3000 messages per second while _strictly_ preserving the message order.

Snapshot: Create queue - General details

1. _Configuration details_ - You can set the following items:
  * _Visibility timeout_ - The time-duration (0 seconds - 12 hours) after which a _consumer_ message can become visible to the other consumers. Generally, the consumer must process and delete a message from the queue.
  * _Message retention period_ - The duration (1 minute - 14 days) for which the queue retains a message that does not get deleted. Amazon SQS will automatically delete messages that have been in a queue for more than the specified period.
  * _Delivery delay_ - The time (0 seconds - 15 minutes) to intentionally delay the delivery of each (new) message added to the queue. According to AWS:
> 
> If your consumers need additional time to process messages, you must delay each new message coming to the queue.

  * _Maximum message size_ - It should be between 1 KB and 256 KB.

1. _Access policy_ - You can define specifically who can send/receive messages to/from your queue. Choose the queue owner, or specified AWS accounts, IAM users, and roles as sender/receiver. The access policy can also be defined in JSON format.

## C. Details of an Existing Queue

Select a queue from the **Queues** dashboard to view the basic details and configuration.

Snapshot: Details of an existing queue

In the snapshot above, the URL `https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/014421265158/MyQueue` is an essential field to use in your application components. In addition, you can also view details about the Lambda triggers, and the access policy. You can even monitor various metrics, such as approximate age of message, the number of messages sent/received/delayed/deleted/empty receives, and size consumed by sent messages.

## D. Send and receive messages

For the selected queue, you can either send/receive messages or configure Lambda function trigger. Let's see how to send and receive messages using a _Standard_ queue.

1. **Send message**  
Specify the message body and delay duration while sending a message. As stated earlier, you must add a delay to each new message, if your consumers need additional time to process messages. In other words, your consumer will receive the message only after the duration specified here.

You can also mention the metadata, such as timestamps, geospatial data, signatures, and identifiers in the form of _Message attributes_.

In a FIFO queue, there is an additional concept of _message group_, to ensures that the messages belonging to a particular group are processed in a strict order.

Snapshot: Message body and delay duration while sending a message

1. **Receive messages**  
A consumer cannot choose a specific message to receive. Instead, a consumer _polls_ to receive up to 10 number of messages from the queue. The snapshot below shows a message received after polling. The default polling duration is set to 30 seconds.

Next, click on the message ID to view the message details, body, and metadata. Later, delete the message manually, if not in use.

> **Note**: SQS pricing is based on the count and size of messages, and the interactions with Amazon S3 and the AWS Key Management Service.
