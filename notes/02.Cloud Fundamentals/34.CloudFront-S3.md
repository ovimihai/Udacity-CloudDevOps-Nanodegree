# S3 & CloudFront

---

In this hands-on exercise, you will access private S3 bucket content via a Cloud Front distribution. You will also learn that CloudFront, after caching, speeds up the delivery of content to your website.

1. Prerequisites: AWS Account
2. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
  * Create and configure a bucket
  * Upload an object to a bucket
  * Create distribution

Follow the exercise instructions described below:

### Step 1\. Create S3 Bucket

* From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) page, select the S3 service.
* Use the **Create bucket** wizard to create a bucket with the following details:

FieldValue

Bucket nameYour choice  
Bucket name must be globally unique

RegionDefault

Block all public accessTurn on  
Block the public access.

Bucket VersioningDisable

Server-side encryptionDisable

* Once the bucket is created, you will be taken to the **Buckets** dashboard. Click on the bucket name to view the details, and upload files and folders.

Click the "Add files" to upload a file

### Step 2\. Upload Object to Bucket

* Once the bucket is open to view its contents, click the **Upload** button to add files/folders.

* Click the **Add Files** button, and upload the Sample.html (or any file from your local computer) provided at the bottom of the current page.

* Note that the Bucket has not allowed public access, therefore, the `Sample.html` file cannot be accessed via its object URL, such as `https://my-014421265158-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sample.html`.

> **Note** - In the steps above, the object URL will be different in your case.

The figure above shows how to copy the S3 object URL.

The figure above shows `AccessDenied` error while trying to access the file via its S3 object URL

The figure above shows that the individual object (Sample.html) has no public access.

### Step 3\. Create CloudFront Distribution

* Select the **CloudFront** service from the **Services** menu at the top left corner of your AWS console.

* Start the **Create Distribution** wizard.

* Under the **Web** delivery method, click the **Get Started** button, and use the following details to create a distribution:

SectionFieldValue

Origin SettingsOrigin Domain NameSelect the S3 bucket that you created in the step above

Origin PathEnter `/` to indicate the root level

Restrict Bucket AccessYes

Origin Access IdentityCreate a New Identity  
(Allow access to the S3 content using CloudFront URL)

Grant Read Permission on BucketYes, Update Bucket Policy  
Automatically updates the bucket access policy in S3  
to allow CloudFront to access the bucket content

Default Cache Behavior SettingsViewer Protocol PolicyRedirect HTTP to HTTPS

> In the configuration table above, the **Grant Read Permission on Bucket** says that "Yes, update access bucket policy automatically to allows the **Origin Access Identity user** access to the bucket content." Origin Access Identity user represents the CloudFront service. The policy is a JSON file that defines the access permissions to the bucket object.

* Leave the defaults for the rest of the options. It may take up to 10 minutes for the CloudFront Distribution to get created. Upon successful creation of the CloudFront distribution, the S3 bucket access policy will also get updated automatically, as shown below.

The figure above shows the updated S3 access policy. We will learn more about the access policies in the upcoming lessons.

* Once your CloudFront distribution is created, and the status shows as **Deployed**, copy its _Domain Name_ (such as, `dgf7z6g067r6d.cloudfront.net`) and append `/Sample.html` before pasting it in a new browser.

* For the initial few attempts, your `https://dgf7z6g067r6d.cloudfront.net/Sample.html` may redirect to `https://my-014421265158-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sample.html`, which is why you may still see an `AccessDenied` error.  
  

> **Note** - Remember, as soon as your CloudFront distribution is **Deployed**, it attaches to S3 and starts caching the S3 private pages. Once the caching is complete, the CloudFront domain name URL will stop redirecting to the S3 object URL. CloudFront may take 10-30 minutes (or more) to cache the S3 page, and you will be able to view the webpage, as shown below.

> **Note** - In the steps above, the exact domain name and the object URL will be different in your case.

Final output at `https://dgf7z6g067r6d.cloudfront.net/Sample.html`. However, at the same time, the `https://my-014421265158-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sample.html` will not work.

* Good to read - [Restricting access to S3 content by using an Origin Access Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-granting-permissions-to-oai)

### Step 4\. Delete Bucket and Distribution

1. **Delete the CloudFront distribution**
  * On the **Distributions** dashboard, click on the radio button next to the **Delivery Method** for the distribution. Click **Disable**, and confirm the prompt.
  * Once the distribution is disabled, you can delete it by selecting the radio button next to the **Delivery Method** and clicking the **Delete** button.
  * You may also need to delete the **Origin Access Identity** users. To do so, you can go to the **Origin Access Identity** service in the CloudFront dashboard.

Delete OAI users

1. **Delete the S3 bucket**
  * To delete the S3 bucket, navigate to the S3 service.
  * Select the radio button next to the name of the bucket you want to delete. Note that the bucket you want to delete should be empty before deletion.
  * Click the **Delete** button on the top-right, and confirm the deletion.
