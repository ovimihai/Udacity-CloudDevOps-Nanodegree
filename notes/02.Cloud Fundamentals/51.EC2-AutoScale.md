[EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) is a service that ensures you have the _desired_ number of EC2 instances always up and running to handle the expected load for your application. To set-up an Auto Scaling group, you require the following basic details:

1. _Count of instances_ - The desired count of the EC2 instances you want to have available. If any instance goes down/fails, a new instance automatically spins up.
2. _Launch template_ - The auto scaling group contains a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a logical group. All EC2 instances within a group share the same configuration. Therefore, You need to **specify the configuration details**, such as, the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances. You specify the configuration details in a **Launch template**.

1. _Scaling policy_ - The auto scaling policy that defines how to scale your EC2 instances automatically, based on demand

## A. Start the Auto Scaling Groups service

Go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home), and select the **Auto Scaling Groups** service from the left navigation pane. See the snapshot below. For first time users, it may take you to the [homepage](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd9991/parts/7cc41faf-07d6-41aa-a205-168d58571430/modules/693ec1fd-e3b8-4f50-9dea-55b5f74ce61c/lessons/0bb66f32-2dfe-49bf-b441-7870a77aefeb/concepts/console.aws.amazon.com/ec2autoscaling/home). Please devote a moment to read through the introduction.

## B. Create an Auto Scaling group

The **Create Auto Scaling group** is a seven-step process, as shown in the snapshot below. Provide a launch template or configuration in the first step. AWS prefers launch templates over launch configuration files. (_Although, both convey similar information._) If you do not have a pre-created launch template, you can create a launch template from the current step.

Snapshot: Create an Auto Scaling group wizard

In the remaining steps, you can configure group size, scaling policies, notifications settings, and tags. The group size allows you to mention the minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances in the group, such that `min <= desired <= max`. For scaling policies, you can create and add either a **step/simple/target** scaling policy.

* **Launch template**  
As mentioned above, a launch template specifies the configuration details, such as, the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances. See a quick video below to see the information available in a launch template.

Let's have a walkthrough of an Auto Scaling Group which has already been created.

1. Select an Auto Scaling Group
Go to the EC2 Dashboard, and select the Auto Scaling Groups service from the left navigation pane. Select an Auto Scaling Group which has already been created.


Snapshot: Select an Auto Scaling Group

2. View Details of the Selected Auto Scaling Group
Once you select an Auto Scaling Group, you can view further details, as shown in the snapshots below.


Snapshot: Details of an Auto Scaling group

3. Launch template
A Launch Template specifies instance configuration information, such as, the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that will be used to launch EC2 instances.

View the Launch template used in the current Auto Scaling group. In the snapshot below, we have the following configuration:

Amazon Linux 2 AMI
t2.nano instance type
An existing key pair to log in to the EC2 instances. We have kept the rest of the other things as default.

Snapshot: The Launch template used in the current group

4. Activity
On the activity tab, the Status column shows the current status of your instances. In the snapshot below, notice that we have a list showing that one instance was created initially, and later it was terminated. Consequently, the auto scaling group has automatically spun up a new instance.

While your instance is launching, the status column shows In progress. The status changes to successful after the instances are launched.

You can also use the "Refresh" button to see the current status of your instances.

5. Auto Scaling
Scaling policies allow you to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 capacity automatically, based on demand. You can create and add either a step /simple/target scaling policy.


Snapshot: View/add policies for the current group

6. Instances Management
View the list of instances running as part of the current group. In the snapshot below, you can see that your autoscaling group has launched your EC2 instance and that it is InService. Similarly, you can view other details, such as AZs, and the health status of each instance.


Snapshot: List of instances in the current group

7. Instance refresh
An instance refresh allows you to trigger a rolling replacement of all previously launched instances in the Auto Scaling group with a new group of instances.


Snapshot: Click on the "Refresh" icon for rolling replacement of the instances.
