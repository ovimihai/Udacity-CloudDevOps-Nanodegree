According to AWS:
> 
> [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) is a managed NoSQL database service that automatically manages the hardware provisioning, setup, configuration, replication, software patching, and cluster scaling.

For in-depth details, refer to the [Amazon DynamoDB: How It Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.html). On this page, let's see how to create a table, and view the details of an existing table.

# A. DynamoDB Dashboard

Go to the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home), where you can view metrics for all of the tables that exist in your account. Let's start the **Create table** wizard.

## B. Create a Table

Follow the guided steps available on the **Create table** wizard. See the snapshot below.

Snapshot: Follow the guided steps available on the **Create table** wizard. Currently, it shows step 1 of 6\.

## C. Add Data to the Table

Go back to the **DynamoDB → Tables** dashboard. From the list of all the existing tables, select the one in which you want to add data.

Snapshot: Add data to an existing table, and view more details

The details of the items highlighted in red in the snapshot above are:

### 1\. Create Item

Data can be added in the form of an **item**.
> 
> You can imagine an **item** as analogous to a **row** in a relational table for simplicity.

Every item consists of one or more attributes. Each attribute consists of a name, a data type, and a value. One of the attributes serves as the primary key. See a sample item entry below.

Snapshot: Create an item with the `Artist` and `SongTitle` attribute. Notice on the upper left corner, you can switch the view between **Tree** and **Text**.

Snapshot: The **Text** view of the same item with the `Artist` and `SongTitle` attribute.

### 2\. Details of an Existing Table

There are several useful features provided to help you manage your data found in DynamoDB. For the selected table, you can view the following information in separate tabs:

* _Overview_ - This tab shows high-level details about the table. For example, the table name, partition key, primary sort key (if any), encryption type, and much more. Tables can be encrypted at rest with no overhead. You can also see the region and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which is a unique identifier for the current resource.

* _Items_ - It lists all of the items/data stored in the table.

* _Metrics_ - View the metrics for your table, such as, read/write capacity (units/sec), count of throttled read/write requests, and count of throttled read/write counts.

* _Alarms_ - Set up alarms to notify you if you exceed your capacity limits. For each alarm, you will have to specify a metric and the upper threshold.

* _Capacity_ - Set up the capacity of the selected table to read and write.

* _Indexes_ - Set up the index using a primary key, and project on a set of attributes. Indexes help you to improve querying performance.

* _Global Tables_ - When you set up a table as a global table, that table can exist in two or more AWS regions with automatic replication.

* _Backups_ - A backup helps in restoring a _Point-in-time state_. DynamoDB maintains continuous backups of your table for the last 35 days.

* _Triggers_ - Create triggers, for example, you can have a lambda function run whenever data is inserted into the current table.

* _Access control_ - Set up access control policies (JSON files) that can allow access to the current table from Facebook, Google, or Amazon (not AWS).

## External Resource

AWS has a very useful [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-nosql-table/) to get started with DynamoDB. It has the following guided sections:

* Step 1: Create a NoSQL Table
* Step 2: Add Data to the NoSQL Table
* Step 3: Query the NoSQL Table
* Step 4: Delete an Existing Item
* Step 5: Delete a NoSQL Table

**Note** - The **Create table** wizard available on the DynamoDB console also follows step \#1 of the tutorial mentioned above.

# DynamoDB LAB

---

In this hands-on exercise, you will create a NoSQL database in the cloud.

1. Prerequisites: AWS Account
2. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
  * Create a table
  * Add data to a table
  * Query data in a table

Follow the exercise instructions described below:

### Step 1\. Access the DynamoDB service

* From the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) page, select the DynamoDB service.
* Use the **Create table** wizard to create a table, with the following details:

FieldDescription

Table name`Course`

Partition key`Name`, with `String` datatype

* **Note:** The partition key spreads data against partitions for scalability.
* Keep the remaining fields with the default values

### Step 2\. Add Data to the Table

* Go back to the **DynamoDB → Tables** dashboard. Select the table in which you want to add data.
* Once the table is selected, click on the **Items** tab.
* Start the **Create item** wizard to store the following item.

FieldData typeValue

`Name`String`Course1`

**Add the following new field**

`Teacher`String`Udacity Instructor`

* Follow the same process to add 5 more items.

### Step 3\. Query Data in a Table

* Stay on the **Items** tab in **DynamoDB → Tables** dashboard. Change the `Scan` dropdown to `Query`.
* Where it says `Enter value`, in the row next to the `name` Partition key, enter `Course 1` and click **Start Search**.
* You should see your search results appear in the window.

### Step 4\. Cleanup and delete resources

* To clean up the resources to avoid recurring charges, ensure the table name is selected.
* Click on the **Delete table** button.
* Ensure to select the _Delete all CloudWatch alarms for this table_ option, and click **Delete**.
