AWS allows us to create a volume from either of the following three methods:

1. Create and attach EBS volumes while creating an EC2 instance using the **Launch Instance** wizard.
2. Create an empty EBS volume, and later you can attach it to a running instance.
3. Create an EBS volume from a previously created snapshot, and later you can attach it to a running instance.

**Let's see the set-up wizard create an empty EBS volume, corresponding to option 2 above.**

### A. Get Started

1. To get started, go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and select the **Elastic Block Store** → **Volumes** service in the left navigation pane.

1. Select the **Create Volume** button, as shown in the screenshot below.

Snapshot: EBS → Volume dashboard. You can create new volumes from here.

### B. Volume Specifications

You will be taken to a set-up wizard to create a volume. You will have to specify the volume-details, as mentioned in the snapshot below.

Snapshot: Create Volume wizard

You will have to specify the following details:

1. Volume type - AWS offers various types of volumes, as described in the table below.

1. Size (GB) - Mention the size with-in limits of the type you have chosen above.

1. Availability Zone - It has a default value, or you can choose your preferred AZ.

1. Snapshot ID - Specify the ID of the snapshot if you wish to create a volume from an existing snapshot. Remember, a snapshot is the saved state of another volume at a particular moment.

1. Tag - Specify the key-value pair, such as {Name: Udacity\_Demo\_Volume}

### Volume Types

AWS allows the following types of volumes to be created. Each type of volume has its service capacity. Choose a type based on the underlying application.

|Volume Type|Min (GB)|Max (GB)|I/O per sec|
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
|General Purpose SSD (gp2)|1|16384|[100 - 3000] IOPS|
|Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) and (io2)|4|16384|[100-64000]IOPS|
|Cold HDD (sc1)|500|16384|Not applicable|
|Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)|500|16384|Not applicable|
|Magnetic (standard)|1|1024|100 IOPS (avg)|

According to AWS:

* General Purpose SSD volumes can serve at a rate of \[100-3000\] IOPS with a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GB.
* Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes can deliver up to 64000 IOPS, and are best for EBS-optimized instances.
* Cold HDD and Throughput Optimized HDD types of volume have their predefined throughput (MB/s) with a standard baseline.
* Magnetic volumes, previously called standard volumes, deliver 100 IOPS on average.

Let's have an overview of the information available on the **Volumes** dashboard. Go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and select the **Elastic Block Store** → **Volumes** service in the left navigation pane.

Snapshot 1: EBS → Volume dashboard, and the Description tab

The details of the items highlighted in red above are:

## 1\. List of all Volumes

Here, you can view the list of all the volumes available under your account in a specific region. For each volume, you can see the ID, size, type, I/O per second (service capacity), a snapshot ID of that volume, date of creation, availability zone, current status, whether the volume is encrypted, and the EC2 instance to whom it is attached.

According to AWS:
> 
> An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a **physical hard drive.**

Read more about the EBS volumes [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes.html). There are a variety of operation you can make use of after creating a volume, such as:

* Attach a volume to one or more EC2 instance(s)
* Detach a volume from an instance
* Replace a volume
* View the volume details, and monitor the current status
* Delete a volume

## 2\. Details of Selected Volume

Select the checkbox against the name of any volume from the _List of all Volumes_ shown above. You will be able to view the details of the selected volume.

* **Description tab**  
In the _Description_ tab, you can view the specific information, such as volume ID, snapshot ID, size, date of creation, instance to which it is attached, type of volume, and much more.

Snapshot 2\. Status Checks

* **Status Checks tab**  
Here you can view the health status of the selected volume. There are four possible status: `Okay`, `Warning`, `Impaired`or `insufficient-data`. See more details about the status [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html). In addition, you can view IO status, pre-defined IO performance, dates, and further textual description (selective).

Snapshot 3\. Monitoring tab

* **Monitoring tab**  
Here you can view the I/O performance metrics for the selected volume, such as:
  * read/write bandwidth (kB/sec),
  * read/write throughput (Operations/sec),
  * average queue (Operations)
  * Idle time (%)
  * avg read/write size (kB/Operation)
  * avg read/write latency (msec/Operation)
> 
> **Note** - In the snapshot above, graphs for all the metrics above are blank because we have just created a new volume for the demo purpose, that has't been utilized yet.

Snapshot 4: Tags tab

* **Tags tab**  
Here, you can have a look at the associated tag. In the snapshot above, it shows the `Name` tag with `Udacity_Demo_Volume` value.
