#### Persisting Data

* Most applications need their data to persist and not be lost, which requires a database.
* We don't want a database to be a single point of failure, so we'll use resources that are designed for reliability. For example, RDS for the database, and S3 for the filestore.
* Relational Database Service (RDS): AWS service for creating databases.

#### Choosing a database

* AWS Aurora and MySQL have no additional licensing costs. Microsoft SQL Server will have additional licensing costs.

#### A single RDS Server can host multiple databases

* Note that you can use a single RDS database that hosts multiple applications, each with different logins and users for those applications. In other words, you don't need to create a separate RDS service for each application.

#### Connectivity

* Subnet groups are needed for deploying in multiple AZs.
* We want to place our RDS in more than one Availability Zone (data center). We can place the RDS in two AZs to eliminate single point of failure and to have high availability.
* We created 4 subnets (2 private and 2 public), so the RDS can potentially be duplicated in all four subnets.
* However, keep in mind that we usually prefer to put databases in a private subnet, for security. There may be use cases where you put a database in a public subnet but generally put it in the private subnets.

#### Database Accessibility

Usually, don't make a database public.

* We'll choose "No" for public accessibility" to keep a database private.
* We'd normally use a private IP address to access a database.

#### VPC Security Groups

* **Default** means every resource in the VPC can talk to any other resource that is within that same VPC. We'll keep this default, to allow resources in the VPC to reach the database.

#### Encryption

* We can use encryption for sensitive production workloads. We can disable encryption for our database here.

#### RDS Running cost notice

* Be sure to **delete any RDS databases** that you don't need once you are done practicing because it can be very expensive if you forget it and leave it running for a while!

**See the detailed steps on the next page.**

AWS projects Aurora database service as the most suitable for enterprise-level database requirements. It is a MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible enterprise-class database, According to AWS:
> 
> [Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) supports up to 64TB of auto-scaling storage capacity, 6-way replication across three availability zones, and 15 low-latency read replicas.

Follow the steps below to create an Aurora database.

### A. RDS Dashboard

Navigate to the [RDS dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home). It shows the database-resources summary, such as the count of database instances, the health of the database service, reserved instances, snapshots. You can also view the portion of the allocated storage. You can launch the **Create database** wizard from here.

Snapshot: RDS dashboard

### B. Create a Database

Once you launch the **Create database** wizard, you will be prompted with the following configuration details:

#### 1\. Database creation method

AWS provides two options to choose from:

* **Standard create** - You have set all of the configuration options, including ones for availability, security, backups, and maintenance.

* **Easy create** - You use the industry best-practice configurations. All configuration options, except the Encryption and VPC details, can be changed after the database is created.

Choose the **Standard create** option.

![Standard create: Amazon Aurora](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/February/602d1bf3_screenshot-2021-02-17-at-6.32.23-pm/screenshot-2021-02-17-at-6.32.23-pm.png)

Standard create: Amazon Aurora

#### 2\. Engine options

* Choose Aurora with MySQL compatibility.
* Select the _Provisioned_ capacity and a default version.

#### 3\. Templates

* Use either the **RDS Free Tier **or **Dev/Test **template. On free-tier resources, you can develop and test applications to gain hands-on experience with Amazon RDS.

#### 4\. Settings

* Use the following values:

**Field****Value**

DB cluster identifierudacity-demo-db

Credentials SettingsProvide a username and password of your choice

* The password can either be auto-generated or manually created. Take note of this password, as it is useful for future steps.

#### 5\. DB instance size

* Select the burstable classes (includes t classes).
* Include previous generation classes.
* Choose `db.t2.small` from the dropdown menu.

#### 6\. Availability & durability

* For production databases, use multiple AZs for reliability. If one AZ fails, the other one will still be available. I will create an Aurora Replica or Reader node in a different AZ
