### 1\. Purpose of the `servers.yml` and `server-parameters.json` files

https://youtu.be/lBIDgNZ0O84

We have already created a CloudFormation template (`servers.yml`) and a properties file (`server-parameters.json`) containing the code related to the resources that you will create in this lesson. You can download these files either from the **Resources section** or the [Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c2-Infrastructure-as-Code-v1).
> 
> **We will refer to the files mentioned above as we proceed through the lesson.** We strongly encourage you to follow along with the video demonstrations.

The `servers.yml` file defines various resources, such as security groups, an autoscaling group, launch configuration, target group, load balancer, and listener. Each type of resource has a different set of properties.

The resources defined in the `servers.yml` file

### 2\. Create `demoservers.yml` and `demoservers.json`

To get started, create two new **empty files**, and append the initial code as shown below:

1. `demoservers.yml` file
    
    Description: > Carlos Rivas / Udacity Parameters: EnvironmentName: Description: An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names Type: String Resources: 

2. `demoservers.json` file
    
    [ { "ParameterKey": "EnvironmentName", "ParameterValue": "UdacityProject" } ] 

> We will gradually append code to the files above, after referring/copying from the `servers.yml` and `server-parameters.json`.

Let's start with writing code for security groups.

> Recall that a security group defines the firewall rules, such as the protocol to open to network traffic and the set of valid IP addresses.

We will create two Security groups:

1. `WebServerSecGroup` for the webserver
2. `LBSecGroup` for a load balancer

### Security Group Syntax

* The following is the syntax required to create a **SecurityGroup**:
    
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup Properties: GroupDescription: String GroupName: String SecurityGroupEgress: - Egress SecurityGroupIngress: - Ingress Tags: - Tag VpcId: String 

* In the SecurityGroup syntax shown above:
  * The only required (mandatory) property is `GroupDescription`. It is a String value up to 255 characters without quotes.
  * The `GroupName` is similar to `GroupDescription`, but it's not a required property.
  * The `SecurityGroupEgress` and `SecurityGroupIngress` property rules are the most critical as it defines where the traffic will go. The former defines outbound traffic, whereas the latter defines the inbound traffic.
  * The `VpcId` denotes the VPC ID in which you are creating the Security Group.

### Ingress rules and egress rules

* Ingress rules are for inbound traffic, and egress rules are for outbound traffic.

* Ingress rules restrict or allow traffic trying to reach our resources on specific ports.

* Egress rules restrict or allow traffic originating from our server -- typically we are ok allowing all outbound traffic without restrictions as this doesn't pose a risk for a security breach.

### Example

* The security group below with ingress/egress rules allowing traffic on port 80 using TCP protocol from/to any location:
    
    InstanceSecurityGroup: Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup Properties: GroupDescription: Allow http to client host VpcId: Ref: myVPC SecurityGroupIngress: - IpProtocol: tcp FromPort: 80 ToPort: 80 CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 SecurityGroupEgress: - IpProtocol: tcp FromPort: 80 ToPort: 80 CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0

#### AWS Documentation

* Refer to the description of each property of a security group - [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html)
