#### CloudFormation

https://youtu.be/Uom73nRVUY4

* CloudFormation is a declarative language, not an imperative language.
* CloudFormation handles resource dependencies so that you don't have to specify which resource to start up before another. There are cases where you can specify that a resource depends on another resource, but ideally, you'll let CloudFormation take care of dependencies.
* VPC is the smallest unit of resource.

### Glossary

**Declarative languages**: These languages specify what you want, without requiring you to specify how to get it. An example of a popular declarative language is SQL.  
**Imperative languages**: These languages use statements to change the state of the program.
