### Security Groups

https://youtu.be/NyasAk9s3ys

Security groups are specific to individual resources (EC2 servers, databases) and not to subnets. There are few points that you must remember:

1. **Traffic is blocked by default**  
In the cloud, traffic is completely blocked, so you have to explicitly open ports to allow traffic in and out. This is a general networking concept.

1. **Limit inbound traffic for security**  
For ingress rules, we want to limit inbound traffic, for security, to a single port or just a handful of ports required by the application we are running. For example, if it's a public web server, it will require `port 80` open to the world ( World = `0.0.0.0/0` ). Should you need the SSH port open, restrict this port only to your specific IP address.

1. **For outbound traffic, give full access**  
For egress rules, we want to give the resource full access to the internet, so we give egress access to all ports, from `0` all the way to `65535`.

### AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup

Create the following two Security groups, as shown in the video above. You can refer to the [AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html) documentation if needed.

1. `WebServerSecGroup` for the webserver. The following code must fall under the Resources section in the template.
    
    WebServerSecGroup: Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup Properties: GroupDescription: Allow http to our hosts and SSH from local only VpcId: Fn::ImportValue: !Sub "${EnvironmentName}-VPCID" SecurityGroupIngress: - IpProtocol: tcp FromPort: 8080 ToPort: 8080 CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 - IpProtocol: tcp FromPort: 22 ToPort: 22 CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 SecurityGroupEgress: - IpProtocol: tcp FromPort: 0 ToPort: 65535 CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 

After creation, the firewall rules for this will look like:

Inbound rules for the `WebServerSecGroup`

Outbound rules for the `WebServerSecGroup`

1. `LBSecGroup` for a load balancer. After creation, the firewall rules for this will look like:

Outbound rules for the `LBSecGroup`

> Did you notice the intrinsic function `!Sub` or `!Ref` in the code above? Let's learn about it.

## Intrinsic functions in the CloudFormation template

**AWS provides a few predefined functions that you can use in your template. These functions can assign values to properties that are not available until runtime.** Notice that there a few function-calls in the template (servers.yml) provided to you, such as:

1. [Fn::Sub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-sub.html): This function substitutes value to a property at runtime. You can use this function as `!Sub "$Value"`. For example, the `!Sub "${EnvironmentName}-VPCID"` will substitute the value of **EnvironmentName** parameter during runtime.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/February/601c2273_screenshot-2021-02-04-at-10.04.44-pm/screenshot-2021-02-04-at-10.04.44-pm.png)

Exporting a value of a VPC (`"${EnvironmentName}-VPCID"`) from the **ourdemoinfra** stack. Note that the value of **EnvironmentName** parameter will be substituted at runtime.

1. [Fn::GetAZs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getavailabilityzones.html): This function returns an array that lists Availability Zones for a specified region in alphabetical order. For example, we learned the following code in the last lesson where we are fetching the list of AZs.
    
     PublicSubnet1: Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet Properties: VpcId: !Ref VPC AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 0, !GetAZs '' ] CidrBlock: !Ref PublicSubnet1CIDR MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true Tags: - Key: Name Value: !Sub ${EnvironmentName} Public Subnet (AZ1) 

The example above shows the usage of three more intrinsic functions, `!Sub`, `!Select` and `!Ref`.

1. [Fn::Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-select.html): This function returns a single object from a list of objects by index.

1. [Ref](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html): It returns the value of the specified parameter or resource. You can specify a parameter or a resource by its logical name.

1. [Fn::ImportValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-importvalue.html): This function returns the value of an output exported by another stack.
  * For example, in the last lesson, we created **ourdemoinfra** stack having a VPC and declared its output value.
> 
> Recall that the **Outputs** section in a template declares output values that you can import into another stack.

  * In this lesson, while creating another stack **demoserverstack**, we can refer to the VPC created earlier as:

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/February/601c2285_screenshot-2021-02-04-at-10.05.36-pm/screenshot-2021-02-04-at-10.05.36-pm.png)

Importing the value of the VPC in the **demoserverstack**. Here also, the value of **EnvironmentName** parameter will be substituted at runtime.
