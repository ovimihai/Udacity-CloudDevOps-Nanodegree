### Purpose of the `network.yml` and `network-parameters.json` files

https://youtu.be/Es5BXzhreMk

We have already created a CloudFormation template (`network.yml`) and a properties file (`network-parameters.json`) that contains the code related to provisioning the networking infrastructure.

**However, we strongly encourage you to follow along with the video demonstrations.**

To get started, create two new **empty files**: `ourinfra.yml` and `ourinfra.json`. Then, gradually append code to them, after referring/copying from the `network.yml` and `network-parameters.json`.

### Learning More about a YAML file

The `network.yml` file is included in the **Resources tab** in this page's left sidebar. The same file is also available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c2-Infrastructure-as-Code-v1/tree/master/supporting_material). This file contains the following four sections (we will learn all of them gradually):

1. **Description** - It presents a text description.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/February/6017a812_screenshot-2021-02-01-at-12.34.15-pm/screenshot-2021-02-01-at-12.34.15-pm.png)

Description section. Feel free to edit/change it.

1. **Parameters** - It contains the list of parameters that are being used in the current CloudFormation template. Parameters should be declared above your Resources. Any value that you consider to change in the future, put it as a parameter instead of hard-coding it into your script. Note that each parameter is further defined with the following **properties** (or fields):
  * Parameter Name - You can provide the name of your choice
  * Description - A textual value
  * Type - Identifies the data type of the parameter, such as String or a Number
  * Default (optional) - Presents the default value of the parameter
  * AllowedValues (optional) - Presents the list of all possible values.

For example, here we set the `EnvironmentName` parameter in our sample code from the video:
    
    Parameters: EnvironmentName: Description: An Environment name that will be prefixed to resources Type: String 

You can also provide default values for parameters in case one was not passed in. In this example, you can see that `VpcCIDR` has a default value of `10.0.0.0/16`.
    
    Parameters: EnvironmentName: Description: An Environment name that will be prefixed to resources Type: String VpcCIDR: Description: Please enter the IP range (CIDR notation) for this Type: String Default: 10.0.0.0/16 

The use of parameters in the template makes your CloudFormation templates more reusable, by allowing you to input _custom values_ to your template each time you create or update a stack. These _custom values_ can be defined in a separate JSON file, as we will see later. These parameters are referenced in the **Resources** and **Outputs **section using a `!Ref` intrinsic function.  
  
**Reference**: Refer to the [Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html) documentation for learning more about `!Ref` intrinsic function and all possible properties of a parameter.

Parameters section

1. **Resources**: This (mandatory) section declares the AWS resources that you want to include in the stack, such as Servers, Gateways, VPN Connections, and more. We learned earlier that the `Resource` section is mandatory. You must include **at least one resource** (e.g., a VPC, and an internet gateway) in the CloudFormation template, otherwise, it will give an error when you try to run the script.  
  
Each resource is defined with the help of fields, such as **Name**, **Resource type**, and **Resource properties**.
  * **Name** - It is a string value representing the resource name. You can use a name of your choice.
  * **Resource type** - The resource type identifies the type of resource that you are declaring. For example, `Type: AWS::EC2::VPC` creates a VPC. You can view the [AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) for a complete list of possible resources you can provision.
  * **Resource properties** - The resource **Properties** field has further sub-fields that are specific to each type of resource. See an example below.
    
    Resources: MyEC2Instance: Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance" Properties: ImageId: "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867" 

**Reference**: Refer to the [Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html) documentation for learning more about resource fields, and see more examples.

Resources section

1. **Outputs**: This section declares output values for each resource that you can import into other stacks. For example, you can output the VPC ID for a stack to make it easier to find from another stack/template. You should not output any sensitive information, such as passwords or secrets. For each resource's output, you will have to provide the following:
  * Description (optional) - A string
  * Value (required) - The property returned by the `aws cloudformation describe-stacks` command.
  * Export (optional) - The name of the resource output to be exported for a cross-stack reference.

**Reference**: Refer to the [Outputs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html) documentation for examples.

### Understanding the JSON (Parameters) file

* **Why do we need a separate parameter file (JSON)?**  
The separate parameter file (JSON) file helps us to avoid hard-coding the parameters in the template (YAML) file.
* Any named parameters in the **Parameters** section of our CloudFormation template will need to have a matching value in a separate, Parameter file, which is in JSON format. The YAML format is not yet supported for the parameter file. A sample JSON-formatted Parameter file is:
    
    [ { "ParameterKey": "EnvironmentName", "ParameterValue": "UdacityProject" } ] 

Having this additional file with actual parameter values allows you to change data used by your CloudFormation template without the risk of modifying the template directly and possibly introducing a typo or some logical error.

### Creating CloudFormation Stack

* When calling AWS CloudFormation, you'll pass in the name of the `.yml` file as well as the name of the parameter file as parameters to the CloudFormation call. For example:
    
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ourdemoinfra --template-body file://ourinfra.yml --parameters file://ourinfra.json --region=us-east-1 

> **Note** that CloudFormation creates the resources in order, based on their dependencies (VPC and InternetGateway, before creating the InternetGatewayAttachment).

### How to execute the Shell scripts?

* You can run either of the shell scripts (_create.sh_ or _update.sh_) as:
    
    ./<file_name> argument_1 argument_2 argument_3 

For example, you can run the following command:
    
    ./create.sh ourdemoinfra ourinfra.yml ourinfra.json 

The command above is equivalent of running the following:
    
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ourdemoinfra --template-body file://ourinfra.yml --parameters file://ourinfra.json --region=us-east-1 

### Troubleshoot

* While running the AWS commands using either _create.sh_ or _update.sh_ file, if you face permission denied error, then you will have to grant the **execute** permission to the owner (yourself) explicitly as:
    
    chmod +x update.sh chmod +x create.sh 

## Demo - Attach VPC and Internet Gateway

https://youtu.be/fOIOIeDiad0

### Connecting VPC's & Internet Gateways

* **Syntax of VPCGatewayAttachment resource:** It's important to note when connecting an `Internet Gateway` to a `VPC`, we need to define an additional resource called `InternetGatewayAttachment`. This attachment references both the VPC and the InternetGateway. Here is the syntax for the following connection:
    
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment Properties: InternetGatewayId: String VpcId: String VpnGatewayId: String 

> **Note** that you must specify either InternetGatewayId or VpnGatewayId, but not both.

* **Example:** See the **VPCGatewayAttachment** from the video above, referencing both the VPC and the InternetGateway defined above using a `!Ref` intrinsic function:
    
    Resources: VPC: Type: AWS::EC2::VPC Properties: CidrBlock: !Ref VpcCIDR EnableDnsHostnames: true Tags: - Key: Name Value: !Ref EnvironmentName InternetGateway: Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway Properties: Tags: - Key: Name Value: !Ref EnvironmentName InternetGatewayAttachment: Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment Properties: InternetGatewayId: !Ref InternetGateway VpcId: !Ref VPC
