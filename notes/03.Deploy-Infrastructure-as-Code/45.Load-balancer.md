### What is a Load Balancer?

https://youtu.be/Ygtn4MsZjwA

We learned earlier that a [load-balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple servers (EC2 instances). These servers need not essentially be present in a single subnet. They (servers) can span across numerous subnets in a given VPC. In our example, these servers are residing in the private subnets.
> 
> In general, an application load balancer routes the traffic to one of the target groups based on the application URL path (API endpoints). But, in our case, we have just one target group having all instances serving the same root (`/`) API endpoint.

A load balancer is not exactly a part of Auto Scaling. Still, it helps answer the question: _"If I am running a web application in 20 different servers, how do I set up a single point of entry that guarantees an even workload distribution across all 20 servers?"_ The answer is a load balancer.

A load balancer allows you to reduce your Autoscaling down to 1 server at night when very few people are using your web application, and then Scale up to 10 or more servers during the day, when hundreds or thousands may be using it. The user doesn't experience any difference in availing of the services due to auto-scaling.

### What is a Listener and Listener Rule?

A load balancer requires a listener. A [listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html) is a process that checks for connection requests using the protocol and port that you specify in your code. In comparison, a **listener rule** determines how the load balancer routes request to the registered targets. For example, a listener for an application load balancer will route the particular request to a specific target group based on some conditions we specify, such as URL path.

### What is a Target Group?

A [target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html) is a logical group of EC2 instances spanning across numerous subnets in a given VPC. You must explicitly register an EC2 instance with a target group, after which it will be called a target. In our example, the autoscaling group manages all EC2 instances in the target group, meaning it will automatically add/remove the instances to/from the target group.

Relationship between a Load balancer, Listener, Listener Rule, Target group, and an Autoscaling group. We will code them all.

### Relationship between Target Groups and Auto Scaling groups.

* A load balancer is a device that simply forwards traffic, evenly across a group of servers, known as a Target Group.
* The problem is, we can't specifically name those servers, because if they are part of an Auto Scaling group, this means that they can come and go as demand for your application increases or decreases.

The way around this is, using the `TargetGroupARNs` property of the Auto Scaling group, we can automatically associate any new servers and remove discarded servers from the Target group automatically by simply including the Resource Name (ARN) of our Load Balancer's target group in this property of our Auto Scaling Group. This way, the Load Balancer will always know where to send the traffic.

ARN of our Load Balancer's target group in the **TargetGroupARNs** property of our Auto Scaling Group.

### AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup

_Health Checks_ are the requests your _Application Load Balancer_ sends to its registered targets. These periodic requests test the status of these targets. You can see us defining our _Health Check_ properties in the code below:
    
     WebAppTargetGroup: Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup Properties: HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: 10 HealthCheckPath: / HealthCheckProtocol: HTTP HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds: 8 HealthyThresholdCount: 2 Port: 8080 Protocol: HTTP UnhealthyThresholdCount: 5 VpcId: Fn::ImportValue: Fn::Sub: "${EnvironmentName}-VPCID" 

**In the above example we specify the following:**

* The port where our targets receive traffic - `Port: 80`
* The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets - `HealthCheckProtocol: HTTP`
* The time it takes to determine a non-responsive target is unhealthy - `HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: 10`
* The number of healthy/unhealthy checks required to change the health status - `HealthyThresholdCount: 2` `UnhealthyThresholdCount: 5`
* The healthy threshold represents the number of consecutive health check _successes_ required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. An unhealthy threshold shows the number of consecutive health check _failures_ required before considering a target unhealthy.

### AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer

Our load balancer will be present in the public subnet, and use the dedicated security group we created earler. The code will look like:
    
     WebAppLB: Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer Properties: Subnets: - Fn::ImportValue: !Sub "${EnvironmentName}-PUB1-SN" - Fn::ImportValue: !Sub "${EnvironmentName}-PUB2-SN" SecurityGroups: - Ref: LBSecGroup 

### AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener

The listener to attach to our load balancer will be:
    
     Listener: Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener Properties: DefaultActions: - Type: forward TargetGroupArn: Ref: WebAppTargetGroup LoadBalancerArn: Ref: WebAppLB Port: '80' Protocol: HTTP 

**It will check for the load balancer's connection requests on the HTTP protocol port 80 directed towards the target group.**

### AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerRule

A Listener requires a Listener Rule. The Listener Rule below will determine how (condition) the load balancer's connection requests are routed to the registered targets.
    
     ALBListenerRule: Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerRule Properties: Actions: - Type: forward TargetGroupArn: !Ref 'WebAppTargetGroup' Conditions: - Field: path-pattern Values: [/] ListenerArn: !Ref 'Listener' Priority: 1 

The above listener rule will route all connection requests with the default root (`/`) endpoint to the specified target group.
> 
> Had our application served two different API endpoints, we could have created a dedicated target group for each API endpoint. The listener rule will correspondingly route the first endpoint's connection requests to one target group and the requests for other endpoints to the second target group.

This new stack is cross-referencing the resources that you have already created in the previous lesson. The final command that the instructor has run to create a new stack **ourdemoservers** is (run either one):
    
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ourdemoservers --template-body file://servers.yml --parameters file://server-parameters.json --region=us-west-2 

    ./create.sh ourdemoservers servers.yml server-parameters.json 

In the command above, you can:

* Use stack name of your choice, other than **ourdemoservers**.

* Use your own YAML file instead of **servers.yml** file

* Use your own parameters file instead of **server-parameters.json**

* Create the stack in a different region, say **us-east-1 N Virginia** instead of **us-west-2 Oregon**. Note that you will have to change the AMI ID and the user key-pair name if you switch to a region other than us-west-2 Oregon.
