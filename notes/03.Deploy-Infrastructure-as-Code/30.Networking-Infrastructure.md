### Reference diagram

The file [AWSWebApp.jpeg](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c2-Infrastructure-as-Code-v1/tree/master/supporting_material) is complete a reference diagram that we exported from LucidChart in Jpeg format. Luckily, our VS code editor supports the jpeg format, and we can quickly reference this as a visual checklist to make sure we don't forget any component when writing our CloudFormation script.

Filtered out networking infrastructures, such as VPC, subnets, Internet gateway, NAT gateway, and route tables.

### Learning about the YAML file

The video above shows you the `testcfn.yml` file, which you'd have created in the previous lesson. In the upcoming video demos, you will have to create a new YAML file. Let's learn about the sections present the `testcfn.yml` file:

1. **Format version**: The `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` section is optional. The current valid value is 2010-09-09\. You can add it to your file as:
    
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09 

1. **Description**: The`Description` field is also optional. Here we start by adding a short description of the project we are working on.
    
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09 Description: Carlos Rivas / Udacity - This template deploys a VPC 

1. **Resouces**: Although a description is optional, the `Resources` section is required. Remember to include **at least one resource** (e.g., a VPC, an EC2 instance, a database) in the CloudFormation template, otherwise, it will give an error when you try to run the script.
    
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09 Description: Carlos Rivas / Udacity - This template deploys a VPC Resources: UdacityVPC: Type: 'AWS::EC2::VPC' Properties: CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16 EnableDnsHostnames: 'true'

### AWS command in a Shell script

As demonstrated in the video above, you can save your `aws cloudformation` command in a shell (.sh) script, so that you can run it multiple times easily. The instructor has created the following two shell scripts for the current course:

1. **create.sh**: This file contains the `create-stack` command, which expects three command-line arguments.
    
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name $1 --template-body file://$2 --parameters file://$3 --region=us-east-1 

2. **update.sh**: This file contains the `update-stack` command, and this too expects three command-line arguments.
    
    aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name $1 --template-body file://$2 --parameters file://$3 --region=us-east-1 

> Note: As stated earlier, you can choose either region, **us-west-2** or **us-east-1**.

Moving forward, we will learn and add an additional option, `--capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM" "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM"`, in these commands as:
    
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name $1 --template-body file://$2 --parameters file://$3 --capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM" "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM" --region=us-east-1 

### Practice Fixing Errors

* Practice fixing errors, as this will help you prepare for real scenarios on the job.

* For instance, try altering correct, working YAML scripts to see if they generate an error.

* Practice reading error messages to understand what caused the error, and how to fix them.


## Summary

As this lesson comes to an end, now you should be able to ...

* Describe the syntax of the CloudFormation code that builds the infrastructure
* Build the following resources -
  * Virtual Private Cloud and subnets
  * Internet gateway and NAT gateway
  * Route table
* Export the stack output
