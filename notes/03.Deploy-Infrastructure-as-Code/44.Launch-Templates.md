## Create a Launch Template from Launch Configuration

Previously, we learned that an autoscaling group in our example exercise requires the following:

* VPCZoneIdentifier
* **LaunchConfigurationName**
* Min and Max count of instances
* TargetGroupARNs

But, **you can also use a **[**Launch Template**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/LaunchTemplates.html)**instead of a **[**Launch Configuration**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/LaunchConfiguration.html)**.** Let's understand how to code an AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate from AWS::EC2::LaunchConfiguration.

1. Notice that a [AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-as-launchconfig.html) comprises the following two section:
    
    WebAppLaunchConfig: Type: AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration Properties: 

1. On the other hand, a [AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-launchtemplate.html) has the following sections:
    
    WebAppLaunchTemplate: Type: AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate Properties: LaunchTemplateName: LaunchTemplateData: 

In other words, a LaunchTemplate comprises of two main components: LaunchTemplateName and **LaunchTemplateData**. The LaunchTemplateName is optional, and LaunchTemplateData will have the detailed configuration.

1. The content of the [LaunchTemplateData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-launchtemplate-launchtemplatedata.html) can have various fields and values. However, in our example, the content of the **LaunchConfiguration → Properties** is _similar_ to the **LaunchTemplate → LaunchTemplateData** section. The analogous LaunchTemplate will be:
    
    myWebAppLaunchTemplate: Type: AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate Properties: LaunchTemplateData: UserData: Fn::Base64: !Sub | #!/bin/bash apt-get update -y apt-get install apache2 -y systemctl start apache2.service cd /var/www/html echo "Udacity Demo Web Server Up and Running!" > index.html ImageId: ami-005bdb005fb00e791 KeyName: VocareumKey2 SecurityGroupIds: - sg-020ac9d8f54335c66 InstanceType: t3.small BlockDeviceMappings: - DeviceName: "/dev/sdk" Ebs: VolumeSize: '10' 

In the Launch template above, notice the following important points:
  * It is almost similar to a Launch configuration.
  * It must be defined prior to defining the AutoScalingGroup.
  * We already had a user key-pair with the name `VocareumKey2` in our account. You can use the one you have.
  * In the `SecurityGroupIds` field, we have used a hard-coded value of the web server SecurityGroup we created earlier. It is because, in a nondefault VPC, AWS doesn't allow us to use the `SecurityGroups` field. Instead, we must use security group IDs. Therefore, replace the `sg-020ac9d8f54335c66` with the one applicable to you. See snapshots below for more context:

Use either SecurityGroupIds or SecurityGroups field in a LaunchTemplateData. Source [AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate LaunchTemplateData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-launchtemplate-launchtemplatedata.html#cfn-ec2-launchtemplate-launchtemplatedata-securitygroups)

Get the Security groups ID to use it further in the LaunchTemplate

1. Lastly, change the autoscaling group to use the new LaunchTemplate as:
    
    WebAppGroup: Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup Properties: VPCZoneIdentifier: - Fn::ImportValue: !Sub "${EnvironmentName}-PRIV-NETS" LaunchTemplate: LaunchTemplateId: !Ref myWebAppLaunchTemplate Version: !Ref myLaunchTemplateVersionNumber MinSize: '3' MaxSize: '5' TargetGroupARNs: - Ref: WebAppTargetGroup 

> In the `LaunchTemplate` field above, both the `LaunchTemplateId` and `Version` are mandatory to the specified. Therefore, you may have to create a new parameter `myLaunchTemplateVersionNumber` as shown in the snapshots below:

A LaunchTemplate analogous to the LaunchConfiguration we created earlier.
