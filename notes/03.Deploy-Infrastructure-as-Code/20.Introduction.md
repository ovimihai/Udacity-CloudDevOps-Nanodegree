#### Diagrams

Diagrams are a very important starting point for planning your cloud infrastructure. DevOps engineers start with a visual representation of the required cloud infrastructure before they turn it into code. This lesson will show you how to interpret these infrastructure diagrams.

## Lesson Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn to...

* Make use of [www.lucidchart.com](http://www.lucidchart.com/) to draw the diagram.
* Identify the AWS resources that are required to be used in the diagram.
* Place the resources correctly in the diagram, such as VPC, availability zones, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, autoscaling groups, load balancers, and EC2 instances.

### Supporting Material

#### Lucidchart

We'll use [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com/) to create cloud diagrams. Other applications that generate diagrams include Visio or Cloudcraft.

**Note to students**: You won't need to know how to create diagrams for the project. The goal of this lesson is to get you familiar with cloud diagrams so that you can write cloud formation code based on interpreting the diagrams.
