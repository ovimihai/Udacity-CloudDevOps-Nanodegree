### What is a Launch configuration?

https://youtu.be/QGM_Sf3YuiU

It is a saved-resource that stores the configuration details of an EC2 instance, such as the AMI, instance-type, security-group, key pair, etc. The Autoscaling group uses a launch configuration to launch EC2 instances.

Let's see how you can code a launch configuration.

### AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration

This is an updated **WebAppLaunchConfig** so that you don't need external dependencies, such as Docker in the UserData script.
    
    Resources: WebAppLaunchConfig: Type: AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration Properties: UserData: Fn::Base64: !Sub | #!/bin/bash apt-get update -y apt-get install apache2 -y systemctl start apache2.service cd /var/www/html echo "Udacity Demo Web Server Up and Running!" > index.html ImageId: ami-0ac73f33a1888c64a KeyName: VocareumKey2 SecurityGroups: - Ref: WebServerSecGroup InstanceType: t3.small BlockDeviceMappings: - DeviceName: "/dev/sdk" Ebs: VolumeSize: '10' 

In the example above, we have done the following:

1. Set a `UserData` script that will **run on the new instance automatically after launch**. See the next paragraph for more details.

1. Used the `ami-0ac73f33a1888c64a` as AMI in the **us-west-2** (Oregon) region. If you wish to run the whole exercise in another region, say **us-east-1** (N Virginia), then you will have to change the AMI ID to `ami-00ddb0e5626798373`.

AMI IDs are specific to the region and keep changing with updates in the image. The AMI ID used in the example above is for a **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type** system. You can search the AMI ID of all Ubuntu-based images [here](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/).

1. Assumed that the RSA login key name is `VocareumKey2`. **Please create a key-pair with the name `VocareumKey2` (or any name) in the AWS web console (under EC2 services) before using it in the code above.**

Create a key-pair in the web-console before using it the YAML template

1. Referenced the previously defined `WebServerSecGroup` for our `SecurityGroup`

1. Set our `InstanceType` to `t3.small` . You can also use `t3.medium`, as shown in the video demo above. To see all available instance types, [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#AvailableInstanceTypes).

1. Specified 10gbs for our `VolumeSize`.

**Note**: In a Launch configuration, the only required properties are `ImageId` and `Instance Type`. The remaining ones are optional.

## UserData script

A UserData script is a series of commands that run automatically at the time of instantiating your EC2 instance. The purpose of a UserData script is to properly configure the EC2 instance before running your application.

* **Script to use in your exercise**  
By default, the EC2 instance will not have the Apache Tomcat server installed and running. Use the following UserData script to do so. Note that this script is meant to run only on **Ubuntu Linux** systems.
    
     #!/bin/bash apt-get update -y apt-get install apache2 -y systemctl start apache2.service cd /var/www/html echo "Udacity Demo Web Server Up and Running!" > index.html 

It will first install the Apache Tomcat server, starting the server, and then create an `index.html` page at the default location, `/var/www/html`.

* **Script shown in the demo is different**  
The instructor uses a slightly different UserData script in the demo video above that uses external dependencies, such as installing a Docker and then installing the Apache Tomcat in a Docker container.
    
     #!/bin/bash # Install docker apt-get update apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - add-apt-repository \ "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \ $(lsb_release -cs) \ stable" apt-get update apt-get install -y docker-ce usermod -aG docker ubuntu docker run -p 8080:8080 tomcat:8.0 

**You can use either of the scripts mentioned above. Note that the scripts above are valid only for an Ubuntu VM.**

* **What else you can do with a UserData script?**  
In addition to the example shown above, you can also do things such as:
  * Fetch credentials
  * Set Environment Variables ( ENV=PROD, for example )
  * Download and Install libraries
  * Get your source files or binaries from a storage location, such as S3

* **When should you use the UserData script?**  
If you want to run your application in a plain out-of-the-box Linux or Window server, you'll use the UserData script to do all the necessary configurations. **You don't need it if you are using an AMI that already has everything installed.**

* **How to verify and troubleshoot a UserData script?**  
The best way to create and verify a UserData script is to run each command manually and verify everything works as expected. If you run yours and it fails, you should login to the server and check the logs that can be found here:
    
    /var/log/cloud-init-output.log 

For Windows:
    
    C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Log\UserdataExecution.log 

* **What is the difference between UserData on Windows and Linux?**  
On Windows, you have the option of PowerShell:
    
    <powershell> $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm") New-Item $file -ItemType file </powershell> 

Or more traditional Batch scripts:
    
    <script> echo Current date and time >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log echo %DATE% %TIME% >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log </script> 

## \[Optional\] Additional lnformation

Please note the UserData script above is meant to run only on Ubuntu Linux. Had it been a CentOS-based **Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type**, then you may have to use the following UserData script to install and start the Apache Tomcat server with PHP:
    
    #!/bin/bash sudo yum update -y sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2 sudo yum install -y httpd mariadb-server sudo systemctl start httpd sudo systemctl enable httpd sudo chkconfig httpd on 

Also, in this case, you will have to use different AMI-ID as:

* **us-east-1 N Virginia** - `ami-047a51fa27710816e`
* **us-west-2 Oregon** - `ami-0e999cbd62129e3b1`

The AMI ID varies for each region, and updates periodically. See the snapshot below to know how to get the right AMI ID in your case.

#### WebAppGroup

* An Auto Scaling Group is in charge of providing servers for your application based on an Alarm/Criteria, such as number of concurrent users, CPU Usage or HTTP Requests

* Since The Auto Scaling Group is not specific to your application, you need to provide a Launch Configuration which says which machine image to use and how much memory and disk space your application will need, among other things.

* You can specify a Minimum and Maximum count of servers to use for Auto Scaling -- This is a great feature of cloud that can save you lots of money in unused infrastructure and it's a key example of the elasticity of the cloud.
