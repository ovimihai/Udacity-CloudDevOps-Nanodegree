`Outputs` are optional but are very useful if there are output values you need to:

* import into another stack
* return in a response
* view in AWS console

To declare an `Output` use the following syntax:
    
    Outputs: Logical ID: Description: Information about the value Value: Value to return Export: Name: Value to export 

The `Value` is required but the `Name` is optional. In the following example we are returning the id of our `VPC` as well as our Environment's Name:
    
    VPC: Description: A reference to the created VPC Value: !Ref VPC Export: Name: !Sub ${EnvironmentName}-VPCID 

#### Join Function

---

You can use the `join` function to combine a group of `values`. The syntax requires you provide a `delimiter` and a list of values you want appended.

`Join` function syntax:
    
    Fn::Join: [ delimiter, [ comma-delimited list of values ] ] 

In the following example we are using `!Join` to combine our subnets before returning their values:
    
    PublicSubnets: Description: A list of the public subnets Value: !Join [ ",", [ !Ref PublicSubnet1, !Ref PublicSubnet2 ]] Export: Name: !Sub ${EnvironmentName}-PUB-NETS
