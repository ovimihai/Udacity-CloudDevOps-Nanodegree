# Introduction to Cloud DevOps

Adoption
- all in - set a goal
- baby steps - start with small changes in places you have the most impact

ELSA - change model
- begin with `Event` to improve the release practices
- implement something it was tought imposible so the `Language` changes from "no we can't" to "oh, that might be a thing we cand do"
- as it happens `Structure` begins to give away
- then you have more `Agency`, more freedom to act

Success predictors
- People who can see the problem and are passionate about solving it
- A strong desire to create quality inside the organization
- There is an openness to experimentation and change

First steps
- implement ELSA model in a small scale - small project, share results
- starting directly with Language doesn't work - is hard to change attitude, is hard to convince
- (management) support experimentation and learning

Constant change - you have to start incomplete
- Infrastructure changes
- Requirements changes
- People might not know enough

Deal with org Silos
- don't act as an Change Agent that seeks permission
- act as a Value seeker that take actions

Best practices
- there are only Good practices in a context and a timeline
- you must find the best tooling work for you - learn about all the tools
- advocacy for a tool won't work - try to implement first with the existing tools

Metrics
- set a goal, establish the steps and setup the metrics
- evaluate each part to see where you need to improve
- move the conversation from people/blaming to metrics on things you tried
- have a critical data driven aproach

Antipattern - create/hire DevOps team
Work with the people who know the issues, they probably already have good ideas how to solve it.
